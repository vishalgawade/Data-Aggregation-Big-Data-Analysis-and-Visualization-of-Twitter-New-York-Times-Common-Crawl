HONG KONG  What began as an effort to keep alive an Australian team that was bounced from the elite Super Rugby league has become an experiment that organizers hope will revolutionize the sport and enhance its popularity across the Asia-Pacific region.
Global Rapid Rugby is the brainchild of the Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest, an avid supporter of the Western Force, a franchise based in Perth that, along with two weaker South African teams, was culled from Super Rugby after the 2017 season to streamline and balance the league.
Though skeptics say the project is mostly an outgrowth of Forrests pique at what happened to the Western Force, he said he views it as an opportunity to advance the game he loves.
Like all sports, rugby needs to evolve, he said in a video interview when the first plans for Global Rapid Rugby were announced last autumn. The modern sports public is spoiled for choices and demands easily digestible, fast-paced action.
Plans to put a full, eight-team, home-and-away schedule were derailed by the difficulty of putting everything together in the same year that Japan  one of the countries expected to have a franchise  was hosting the Rugby World Cup. Instead, Global Rapid Rugby has organized a scaled-down Showcase Series of 14 matches featuring the Western Force and teams from five Asia-Pacific countries.
The first match will pit the Western Force against a world all-star team under Australias former national team coach, Robbie Deans, in Perth on March 22.
To fulfill Forrests vision, new rules are aimed to speed up the game and make it more entertaining for fans. Matches have been reduced to 70 minutes from the traditional 80. Also, teams will be awarded an automatic nine points for a power try scored from a move that starts from deep in its defensive red zone  behind the 22-meter line. Under conventional rules, a try is five points with a chance for a two-point conversion, for a total of seven points.
Penalty goals will count for two points instead of three.
The changes in rules are expected to de-emphasize kicking as a defensive tactic and provide greater incentive to keep the ball in play and score tries. Based on a few experimental matches under the new format, its been estimated that the ball will be in play some 30 percent longer than in a typical match under conventional rugby union rules.
Its a format that should appeal to people not steeped in rugby tradition, Robbie McRobbie, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Rugby Union said last week at an event unveiling the South China Tigers, a franchise based in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Rugby Union will manage the new league.
McRobbie said that some of the concepts behind the new league were inspired by the success of the shorter, faster sevens format of rugby, though he stressed that rapid rugby is not a hybrid. But it does bring together many of the elements that make sevens rugby an appealing spectacle, especially the emphasis on speed.
Were big believers in speed, McRobbie said.
With the success of getting sevens into the Olympics, sevens as a format has exploded in the region, he said, in part because being made an Olympic sport brings funding to many countries.
In addition to the Western Force and the Tigers, teams from Singapore, Malaysia and the rugby-mad island nations of Fiji and Samoa will be involved. When the full league gets underway in 2020, teams from Japan and Hawaii are expected to be added, with even further expansion expected in the future.
Organizers also plan to produce tight, 90-minute game telecasts and are negotiating with regional broadcasters. Matches would be streamed live on the Global Rapid Rugby website.
Forrest and the head of rugby for Global Rapid Rugby, Matt Hodgson, a former Western Force star player and captain and Australian national team member, have been recruiting top international players to ensure high-quality rugby for the project.
The Hong Kong-based franchise unveiled a couple of gems last week, most notably Tom Varndell, a speedy wing from the Leicester Tigers of the top English league, Premiership Rugby. Varndell, 32, is the leagues all-time leading try scorer and a player who is widely considered a world-class finisher. After playing for three months in Hong Kong, he will return to Leicester.
It was an opportunity I couldnt turn down, Varndell said last week. Im excited about the way the Asian game is going. Sometimes the game in the Premiership can be turgid and quite slow for the fans, and with this new format there should be more focus on the skills and the speed.
Samisoni Viriviri, one of the stars of Fijis gold-medal winning team at the inaugural rugby sevens at the 2016 Olympics, said he was looking forward to playing for the Tigers because of his success in the World Rugby Sevens Series. That annual tournament in Hong Kong, played every April, is considered a highlight for players and fans.
Viriviri, 30, was the winner of the World Rugby Sevens Player of the Year award in 2014, and like Varndell is a speedy wing in the 15-man game who should thrive in the rapid rugby format.
I always loved playing in Hong Kong, Viriviri said. It is like playing at home for Fijian players and it is always a great experience to come here, and I hope that the fans will enjoy what we are doing this season.
Forrest wants to expand opportunities in top-level rugby with a focus on the large populations in China and India and on the island nations of Fiji, Samoa and Tonga, where rugby is the most popular sport but where talented young players leave to play the game in places like Australia and New Zealand because of a lack of resources at home.
In his video interview, Forrest said he wanted Global Rapid Rugby to have a strong community benefit, which helps explain why the Fiji and Samoa franchises were a high priority.
In places where outstanding young people, both boys and girls, men and women, are often forced to move away from their heartland, their homeland, to reach their potential, this competition will help them stay, Forrest said. He said players from the region are, in many ways, the games future.
The South China Tigers franchise is also seen as a way to help grow top-level rugby in mainland China, where Forrest hopes to eventually base a team. The Tigers have signed two members of Chinas national team: Liu Junkul, a wing, and fullback Ma Chong, Chinas captain in both the seven- and 15-man formats.
Ma and Liu are said to be the first mainland Chinese players to play professionally in an international club-based tournament.
An important step for Global Rapid Rugby was securing the approval of World Rugby, the international ruling body for rugby union. Forrest and Hodgson, his director of rugby, stressed that despite the radical rule changes, Global Rapid Rugby is not a rebel league and does have a green light.
World Rugby and its member unions, Global Rapid Rugby and its founder Andrew Forrest all share the same vision, to develop the sport in one of the fastest growing parts of the planet, Hodgson said in an emailed comment relayed by Mark Doran, the league spokesman. That said, the World Rugby Council wouldnt have supported the concept if it didnt stand up to very close scrutiny.
World Rugbys chief executive, Brett Gosper, has said that he favors anyone who puts money into developing rugby.
If someone comes along with a checkbook and wants to develop the game in areas, in particular where we need that development, Gosper told The West Australian newspaper in September, and Im thinking across parts of Asia which Mr. Forrest has in mind, then thats of interest to us.

Less than a month after theNew England Patriots won the Super Bowl, a group of Massachusetts lawmakers has proposed a bill that would ban organized youth tackle football until after seventh grade.
The bill, which moved to the Massachusetts legislaturesJoint Committee on Public Healththis week, follows unsuccessful attempts by legislators in five other states to pass similar measures to protect growing brains from traumatic injury.
The bipartisan bill, known asNo Hits, would impose financial penalties for any school league or other entity that does not comply.
There is significant science detailing repetitive head impacts have long-term neurological consequences, especially when they occur during brain development, one of the bills sponsors, Representative Paul A. Schmid III, a Democrat, said in a statement.
Although some medical professionals and former N.F.L. players have signaled their support for the measure andpublic opinion could buoy its prospects, the bill is already facing headwinds.
Two representatives who initially supported the measure have withdrawn their names from the bill, and a few other legislators said they would not support it.
Should we ban youth soccer too? asked Representative David Nangle, a Democrat who opposes the bill. Or youth hockey? When do we stop legislating into areas that we shouldnt be?
A spokeswoman for U.S.A. Football, whichgoverns youth football, said in a statement that the organization believes that decisions on allowing children to play football are best left to parents. To that end, she said, it has createda set of guidelinesdeveloped by leaders in athlete development and football.
The executive director of Pop Warner, Jon Butler, said in a statement that the organization had worked to improve player safety by eliminating the three-point stance and removing kickoffs for younger athletes. Banning football is not the answer, but we do agree that we should continue our efforts to make the game safer for our kids, he said.
Studiesby Boston Universityand other research centers have shown that children who began playing tackle football before the age of 12 were at greater risk for cognitive, mood and behavioral issues later in life, as well as conditions like chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.
But there has been opposition to those findings from the N.F.L. and even from well-intentioned parents, said Michael Kaplen, a lawyer whoteaches a legal course on traumatic brain injuryandtracks legislation governing youth tackle football. Mr. Kaplen said that there was no such thing as safer tackling and that a youth leagues promoting safer tackling would be similar to big tobacco companies offering low-nicotine cigarettes.
People dont understand that even a minor blow to the head has risks, he said. It may take years for these problems to become unmasked.
Steve Dembowski, 49, an executive board member of theMassachusetts High School Football Coaches Association, said parents, rather than the state, should be able to make choices for their children.
Considering that kids at that age get concussions playing soccer and baseball and any other sport where they can fall and hit their head on the ground, he said, it seems like an overstep of authority.
Damon Stanton, 43, has two sons who play football, and he coachesyouth football in Hanson, Mass., about 25 miles south of Boston.
I understand the concern, he said, citing the Boston University study. But he said more attention should be paid to the work that is being done to make the sport safer since the knuckle-dragging days when you would hit hit hit, and run until you were puking during practice.
He said his team had invested in new equipment, like foam tires that minimize player contact during practices, and introducedshoulder-tackling techniques developed byU.S.A. Football.
Mr. Stanton acknowledged that he might not be as influential as the Patriots head coach, Bill Belichick, adding that he is not a political guy.
But, he said, Ill definitely be calling my rep to let him know how I feel.
In recent years, tackle football has lost some of its luster among middle and high schoolers, and their parents. In 2017, about 2.4 million athletes from ages 6 to 17 regularly played the sport, down slightly from the year before, according tothe Sports & Fitness Industry Association. Rugby is gaining popularity because its tackling techniques appear less risky, whichincreasingly appeals to coaches who are leery of concussions.
There have been moves in some parts of the country to further address player safety for tackle football at the high school level. This month, the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Associationadopted new guidelinesintended to sharply reduce the amount of contact allowed during high school practices.
But several efforts last year to pass statewide legislation governing youth leagues werequashed by grass-roots movementsled by parents and coaches.
When Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle of New Jerseyproposed banning tackle football for children under 12, parents, coaches and players threatened to vote her out of office, she said in an email.
That bill is currently in limbo.
Unfortunately, the old boys club of politics and football go hand in hand, said Ms. Huttle, a Democrat. This bill has and will continue to receive pushback because it goes against the American grain.
A similar billin New York failed, and Californias Safe Football Act waspulled before a committee vote.The Dave Duerson Act, named after a Chicago Bears player who killed himself at age 50,did not make it past the Illinois legislature. And Marylands proposal, which also would have prohibited heading in soccer,was killed in committee.
These efforts, futile as they sometimes prove to be, still have a positive effect, supporters say.
I really did not expect it to pass, said Delegate Terri Hill, the Democratic legislator who sponsored Marylands bill.
But I think its a conversation we have to have, she said, and I dont think the conversation is over.
Representative Bradley H. Jones, a Republican who is a sponsor of the Massachusetts bill, echoed Ms. Hill.
Some football programs have already made changes indicating that there is at least some recognition of this problem, he said. If this bill does nothing else, I am hopeful that it starts a dialogue that will lead to the implementation of best practices and standards across the board to protect kids from long-term brain injuries.

CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand  The families drifted from the mosques to the hospital, their emotions battered, their eyes bloodshot.
More than a day had passed since the attacks on Fridaythat killed 50 peopleat two mosques in Christchurch, and many still did not know the fate of loved ones they believed were at prayer when the gunman arrived and started firing.
Akhtar Khokhar, who arrived two months ago from India to visit her son, had come to the hospital for answers.
This is my husband, she said, holding up a photo before an imam who was at Christchurch Hospital to try to help family members. He shook his head with uncertainty.
Others faced similar frustrations, with no firm answers about who had died.
This is the best they can do? asked Zuhair Darwish, as his brothers wife in Jordan kept calling, desperate, wanting to know whether to plan a funeral.
Hours before, the gunman who had inflicted all this pain was charged with one count of murder, with dozens more expected.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who flew to Christchurch to visit with families, vowed that our gun laws will change  now is the time. Minutes before the shooting began on Friday, Ms. Ardern was emailed a copy of the racist manifesto purported to be from the gunman.
[Read live updates here from New York Times journalists in Christchurch.]
On Saturday evening, Mr. Darwish, like many others, still could not believe where the horror had landed him: in a hospital cafeteria, renamed a relatives room, that was crowded with grief and hot with anger.
Dozens of family members  teenagers in T-shirts, grandmothers in head scarves, bearded men in jeans  were there, squeezed together and pressing for information from overwhelmed officials.
Its illegal to hide the names from us! Mr. Darwish shouted at a police official, who was fielding questions while standing on a chair at the back of the room, where few could hear him. You have to provide them!
This was not where they belonged, many of the survivors said.
Bloodshed, terrorism and fear were what some of them had left behind, fleeing countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan and Somalia. Others were born here, used to relative quiet and peace. But in the land of emerald green rugby pitches, hatred found them all anyway.
[Go here to read how the attack unfolded on Friday.]
They responded with the full range of human emotion. Walking between the mosques and the hospital revealed countless examples of tears and outrage. There was debilitating sadness. There was confusion, but also the kind of love you see in hugs that hold tight and bring tears without concern for who is looking.
This is a test, said Zia Aiyaz, 32, an engineer originally from Afghanistan who flew to Christchurch from Hamilton, New Zealand, to help the families of those who were killed or wounded. God is testing us  testing the families and us, and were here to help.
Islamfirst arrived in Christchurch in 1854, with a family from India, local history says. Its roots strengthened in the 1970s with the arrival of Afghan immigrants, and again in the 90s with new arrivals from other countries.
The Muslim community is neither highly visible nor invisible here in Christchurch, a pleasant city of 350,000 near the South Islands Pacific Coast. Mostly Sunni, they are part of a small but growing group of around 46,000 Muslims overall in a country of 4.6 million. In Christchurch, their ranks include students at local universities, taxi drivers, professionals, nurses  and imams like Lateef Alabi.
A leader at the Linwood Mosque, he is originally from Nigeria but is also close to finishing a Ph.D in Malaysia. He has been in New Zealand for three years.
On Saturday, he moved briskly between all the areas where families had gathered, having changed into a clean, gray dishdasha robe. His garment from the day before had been stained with blood.
He often found that he had little to offer those in need.
When Ms. Khokhar found him, and told him her husband had been at Al Noor Mosque, he shook his head and just said, Oh no. That was where 41 people had been killed.
Many of those who attended prayers on Friday were regulars, for whom Islamic practice was woven into engaged lives in the city.
Yasir Amin Nasr, 35, who moved from Lahore, Pakistan, five years ago, now works for the Christchurch City Council. He and his father, Muhammad Amin Nasr, had parked their car up the road from Al Noor Mosque on Friday and were walking toward the building when they first heard gunfire.
After another burst of gunshots, he pleaded with his father to run away, and quickly. But it was too late.
Two, three seconds, he was just in front of us, pointing the gun at us, Mr. Nasr said, trying to show a distance of some eight yards separating them from the gunman.
I saw him. He looked at us, Mr. Nasr said. He was driving. He stopped the car when he spotted us and he got his gun.
Mr. Nasr said the gunman aimed the weapon across the drivers side of the car, through the passenger window toward him and his father and began firing.
His father was hit twice. On Saturday night, he was in critical condition in Christchurch Hospital.
His father, a regular traveler to New Zealand, had arrived three weeks ago for this latest visit and had planned to stay for longer than usual.
He likes it here, Mr. Nasr said. He said he would stay for at least one year because of peace, because here he has nothing to worry about, he can just relax.
More might have died at the Linwood Mosque but for the selfless actions of Abdul Aziz, 48, who was praying there with his four sons when he heard gunshots.
Rather than fleeing, he ran toward the sound and grabbed the first thing he could find  a credit card machine  and tossed it at the attacker. He then tried to draw the gunmans attention to himself, and away from other worshipers, by weaving through cars in the parking lot.
Mr. Alabitold The Associated Presshe believed the death toll would have been far higher without Mr. Azizs actions.
Mr. Aziz, originally from Afghanistan, said he saw the attacker drop one of his guns and managed to grab it. But when he pulled the trigger, the gun was empty. When the gunman went to his car, presumably to grab more ammunition, Mr. Aziz said he threw the gun at the assailants windshield, shattering the glass. The assailant sped away.
Perhaps because of where the shooting took place  a country where there are fewer than a dozen murders in some years  many of the survivors found themselves reaching back in time, using words like peace and quiet, calm and safety.
Mr. Darwish, 40, said that was how he persuaded his brother, Kamel, to move to New Zealand from Jordan: I told him its the safest country in the world and the best place to raise kids.
He was here for six months, he added. He was going to bring his wife in a month.
Instead, Kamel was missing and presumed dead.
Inside the hospitals relatives room, Mr. Darwish could not contain his frustration. Several relatives had to walk him outside to help him calm down when a local imam he didnt know stood up and tried to explain that they were trying to wait until all the names had been confirmed and all the bodies identified before sharing information with the group.
We want connectivity, said the imam, Mustafa Farouk. So everyone gets closure at the same time.
Others in the crowd demanded an alternative, something quicker so we can rest! shouted one man in a far corner.
Mr. Farouk explained that some of the victims were unrecognizable because of their wounds. Another imam reminded them that its not a car accident, its an international crime scene, and that officials had to be careful not to get anything wrong.
Still, the crowd pleaded: Let people share photos. Let imams who know some of the dead identify them.
For a time, the pain brought division. Then the discord was broken when a man shouted Allahu akbar!  God is great  and called for patience.
A few minutes later, officials announced that they would not wait for all the bodies to be identified. They acceded to the communitys demands and let people send photos to the police and choose imams to identify those they could.
The survivors knew this victory would only bring more pain. But at least they were moving toward a resolution, together and alone.

(Reuters) - Stormers captain Siya Kolisi has been rested from his side's final match of their dismal Super Rugby Australasian tour against the Melbourne Rebels on Friday.
Kolisi will return to South Africa along with the injured duo of outside back SP Marais (hip) and lock Chris van Zyl (back), with centre Dan Kriel and hooker Chad Solomon set to link up with the squad in Australia, the team confirmed on Sunday.
The Stormers have been beaten by Wellington Hurricanes, Auckland Blues and Queensland Reds on their tour. Kolisi took responsibility for the Friday's 24-12 defeat by Queensland Reds after his yellow card swung the fixture in favour of the home side.
Kolisi is likely to captain the Springboks at the World Cup in Japan later this year and had started each one of the Stormers seven fixtures so far this season.
The Stormers have won three matches and are bottom of the South African conference.

TOULOUSE, France  Former France coach Guy Noves is entitled to one million euros (£862,415) in compensation for wrongful dismissal by the national rugby federation, a French court said on Monday.
The FFR alleged Noves was guilty of serious misconduct, but a Toulouse labour tribunal decided otherwise. Noves was asking for 2.88 million euros.
Both parties have the right to appeal, although initial reactions suggested that they had accepted the outcome.
"I am satisfied with this decision. The FFR said there was serious misconduct and the tribunal said there was none," Noves, the first France rugby union coach to be sacked, told reporters.
"I don't know if we are going to appeal, we have a month to do so. The demands (from Noves) were excessive and the decision is reasonable," the FFR's lawyer Joseph Aguera told French sports newspaper L'Equipe.
The FFR later welcomed a "balanced" decision and said in a statement it did not plan to appeal.
Noves was sacked by the FFR in December 2017 after winning seven of his 21 matches in charge, while his contract was due to run until the end of this year's World Cup in Japan.
Noves, 65, was replaced by Jacques Brunel, who has been struggling to turn the situation around.
France beat Scotland and Italy in this year's Six Nations but lost against England, Ireland and Wales to finish fourth.

Former rugby player Christian Wade has been allocated to the Buffalo Bills as part of the NFL's International Player Pathway Program, the team announced on Monday.
The 5-foot-8, 190-pound Wade was a highly decorated rugby star in the United Kingdom, having played for the national team at the U16, U18 and U20 levels, as well as making the British and Irish Lions squad. He retired from the rugby union last year to pursue playing in the NFL.
Wade's 82 tries (touchdowns) in Premiership Rugby, mostly as a ballcarrier, is third all-time and he has been designated as a running back with the Bills.
Wade, 27, is one of seven international athletes from five countries who have been training in Florida with the goal of landing one of four placements among AFC East teams this offseason. He participated in a pro day last week, where he was timed at 4.53 seconds in the 40-yard dash.
The four clubs will be allowed to carry an extra player (91 total) during training camp and, should the player not make the final roster, will also receive an extra practice squad spot for the allotted player. However, those placed on the practice squad with the international player exemption will be ineligible to be activated during the season.
The International Player Pathway Program began in 2017 and rotates through divisions each year.

LONDON  In the British capital, it is the calm before the storm. The countrys scheduled departure from the European Union  Brexit  is mere weeks away, although no deal has been reached. And so little is clear about what will become of Britain in the wake of its decision to Leave that many people seem resigned to the uncertainty of the moment. There is a tempest bearing down. But until then?
Until then, it is London Fashion Week, which wrapped up its biannual round on Tuesday.
Fashion is a multibillion-dollar industry in Britain, and a global one: It can neither afford to grind to a halt for Brexit nor afford to ignore it.
Theres nothing we can really do, Molly Goddard said after her show in answer to the inevitable questions. We have a lot of European partners but beyond that I dont really know. Ms. Goddards signature are many-tiered tulle dresses, candy-pink confections that can each require 200 feet or more of fabric  the lady as layer cake  but this season she showed them undergirded with trousers and boots beneath, and balaclavas above. Everything was meant to be stomped in, she said.
Like the Boy Scouts say: Be prepared. Ms. Goddard, whose dresses can look princess-y, has always understood that there is no inherent contradiction between sweetness and strength. Not for nothing is one of her most famous customers Villanelle, the deadly assassin in Killing Eve. (Never mind that Villanelles fictional.)

It is unfair to demand that designers reflect the politics of the moment in their work, and unfair to ask them to be spokespeople for the decisions of government ministers. Yet the question bubbled up again and again over the course of five days in London, in the backstage scrums where they faced the press and explained their work: Dont youhateBrexit? said a voice from the crowd that was facing down Riccardo Tisci, Burberrys chief creative officer, on Sunday under the hot, sharp glare of the lights at the Tate Modern following his second show for the brand.
I cannot answer, Mr. Tisci said. Everyone has a different opinion, of course.
But he had called his show Tempest. And he had just finished opining that we need the younger generation to be more free, and express themselves. He felt there had been greater freedom 20 years earlier, when he was studying at Central St. Martins. But two days before, London schoolchildren had skived off classes  Americans call it cutting, but the Britishism really captures the sense better to noisily protestinaction on climate change in the streets. It seemed Mr. Tisci was the less-free one, practicing the diplomatic parry of the corporate steward.

He has, after all, a behemoth to consider. Burberry aspires to be all things to all people, and Mr. Tisci ticked off the strength he felt the label deserves to have: not only fashion, but accessories, evening wear, streetwear, underwear, expensive clothes, affordable clothes. (All things being relative: Burberry T-shirts, like the one Mr. Tisci was wearing, can cost $390.)
To me, Burberry is lifestyle, he said. Its not a fashion label. It represents a lifestyle. And it represents a country.
With a remit that broad, it only makes sense that he based his collection on the idea of including, not excluding things. In the Tate, he divided his show space into two: one room, concrete, grimly lit, with chain-link fence; the other a kind of private theater with gleaming wood and cushioned seats. The tough and the posh.
He divided the collection along the same lines. There was a streetwear section of rugby shirts and puffers, trainers and track pants. Then came the bourgeois: the good old Burberry trench, fluty dresses, trailing scarves. (It would be nearly impossible to mistake one for the other, but if, say, you were viewing from space, the hair was the tell: gorgeous, elaborate curlicues more or less tattooed to the models foreheads for the street; sober, severe buns for the rest, snug in their own little nets.)
It had more sharpness and more bite thanMr. Tiscis first collection for Burberry, which was washed-out in a medley of dutiful beige. But it nevertheless had more of the attitudes of aggression (familiar to Mr. Tiscis fans from his years at Givenchy) than real snap. For all its enormous breadth, it felt more styled than meant, a tempest that would fit neatly in a teapot.
Mr. Tisci played with references of Cool Britannia, rave and chav (British for lout), and the vaunted DNA of Burberry  a word fashion executives love to use, in an eerily eugenic way. But the effort to be everything to everyone is enervating, and no doubt exhausting. Its no secret in the industry that lifestyle is the lifeblood of the business: Those that cant afford or cant wear luxury runway fashion have to be invited in with a T-shirt, a boxer brief, a perfume, a handbag, a keychain. But is that effort killing fashion?
Im sorry. Thats grouchy.
Its not Mr. Tiscis fault that fashion has grown so giant. Lifestyle is the general ambition.
It is clearly Victoria Beckhams. But then, shes already a lifestyle. Ms. Beckham is an icon in a truer sense of the word than is usually meant by the terms constant invocation  images of her are studied and revered  and she has built up a line offering women a way to dress like her.

This fall, after a trial run with Estée Lauder, she intends to introduce her own makeup collection. And at a preview at her studio in West London a few days before her show, she said that skin care will follow after that.
So when a bright red she called lipstick red rippled through the collection, you got what she was gesturing at. But it went down gently because Ms. Beckham delivered a collection, on a sunny Sunday morning at the Tate Britain, that was focused, appealing and, most importantly, real: suits and nipped-waist blazers, slouchy trousers and longish skirts, dresses and coats and muzzy knits that women could wear. Not only out but in: Into the office, into the lunch meeting, into the Tube.
We know my customer, Ms. Beckham said, and for a change, you believed it.

Fantasy predominates at fashion week, often fabulously so. When Joan Collins finally comes scampering into an Erdem show half an hour past its scheduled start gasping, I was stuck in the lift!, you pinch yourself. Is this a dream? When Christopher Kane designs a collection around balloon fetishists and latex kinksters, looners and rubberists, you pinch yourself  or worse. (Im not here to judge.)
But throughout London, the strongest impressions were made by clothes that seemed destined to go farther than the runway and Instagram, more life than lifestyle. No disrespect to the palliative power of fantasy but, with tempests on the horizon, the real way may be the wise way.
Away from the hamster wheel of hype are designers who have been working away steadily for decades, artists of the small detail and subtle tweak. Margaret Howell is one of those: After more than 40 years in business, she remains so discreet and so untroubled by the need for acclaim that you could spot her (if youcouldspot her) casually chatting, unrecognized, in the stairwell to her show space as dozens of guests there to see her show streamed obliviously past. But her collection was filled with pieces you would be glad to own, their proportions ever so slightly improved. Hussein Chalayan, who celebrateshis 25th anniversaryin business this year, is another: He has a wonderful way of reworking something you know  a white shirt, an unstructured blazer  into something recognizable but new, so you see it fresh.
Real women, real clothes. They were there at Simone Rocha, whose show was all the more affecting for its casting of models of different ages and different sizes, just as her real clients are. When Chloë Sevigny came ambling down the runway, smiling, it didnt feel like a stunt, any more than when Jeny Howorth or Jade Parfitt or Tess McMillan followed. Ms. Rochas collection has a place for them all.
And real clothes were at J.W. Anderson, who often strays into hinterlands of the esoteric. He didnt here, although he also didnt dull himself into normalcy either. Jonathan Anderson said he wanted to take the noise out and focus on clothing, and the collection was a reminder that he can: That behind the theatrics and the riddles that sometimes dog his efforts are often very good clothes. Here they were on dazzling display, in particular, his beautiful wrap coats and puddling trousers.

Its tempting to think of Mr. Anderson floating above it all, especially when he said that he had designed his set, with its little rocks poking out of cream-colored carpet to suggest mountaintops poking through the clouds  as if his models were sailing over the sky, safe from the storm. But this was a much more grounded collection for Mr. Anderson, and all the better for it.
Shows like that put me in a good mood, Sidney Toledano, the chairman and chief executive of the LVMH Fashion Group, a minority stakeholder in the brand, whispered to Mr. Anderson.
Little else at the moment may be clear but this: I felt the same.

(Reuters) - Rugby internationals from two codes, Australian Valentine Holmes and England's Christian Wade, have been added to the practice squads of the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills as part of the NFL's international player pathway program.
Australian rugby league international Holmes, a prolific try-scorer for the Cronulla Sharks, ripped up his contract with his club at the end of last season to pursue his dream of playing in the NFL.
The 23-year-old has been listed as a running back/wide receiver/kick returner and will be hoping to follow in the footsteps of compatriot Jarryd Hayne, who suited up in eight regular season games for the San Francisco 49ers in 2015.
The pacy 27-year-old Wade played one rugby union international on the wing for England in 2013 after building a reputation as one of the best finishers in the game. He is projected to play at running back, the Bills said.
Both players will be the 11th man on their teams' practice squads, and 91st on the roster overall, and be retained at least through to the end of their pre-season training camps.
Four AFC teams will carry an extra player on their squads this year under the program, which aims to provide hopefuls from around the world to "compete at NFL level, improve their skills, and ultimately earn a spot on an NFL roster".

SYDNEY  Australia's players' union has joined Melbourne Victory boss Kevin Muscat in denouncing the "dangerous" Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) pitch after a player suffered a knee injury during an A-League match against Sydney FC on Saturday night.
Midfielder Terry Antonis fell to the ground untouched on the edge of the cricket square during a 2-1 loss for his side in a clash between the last two Australian champions.
The iconic ground is being used for football codes while the neighbouring Sydney Football Stadium is re-vamped and has already attracted criticism after it was torn up during a rugby match.
"It was dangerous, first and foremost," Muscat told reporters.
"To ask players to come and work under those conditions is unacceptable. It might be a serious injury as a result from it. And for players to go out onto that, whatever it's called, is a disgrace."
Professional Footballers Australia (PFA) called for an independent investigation into how the match was allowed to go ahead given the "deplorable state" of the pitch, which the body said posed a "clear danger" to "player safety".
"The players confirmed with us last night that they were not consulted at any stage on whether or not the match should proceed, notwithstanding the clear issues that the pitch presented to their livelihoods," chief executive John Didulica said in a statement.
"The PFA will ... recommend two clear resolutions for adoption. Firstly, that FFA immediately commission an independent investigation into the process undertaken to approve last night's match as being fit for play.
"Secondly, endorse a motion that players will no longer play on surfaces unacceptably compromised by a cricket wicket."
Sydney FC, whose victory kept them second in the A-League, are scheduled to host league leaders Perth Glory at the ground on April 18.
"The pitch clearly wasn't up to the standards required for professional football and we are working with the SCG Trust and FFA to assess its suitability to host our game against Perth in 11 days' time," said Sydney FC chief executive Danny Townsend.
"All options are on the table, including moving the game, and those discussions are already underway."
Some 3,000 square metres of turf at the ground were replaced last month after huge divots came up during a rugby union match between the New South Wales Waratahs and Queensland Reds.
The Sydney Roosters rugby league team have also used the ground and the various codes have varied the layout of the pitch in order to mitigate the impact of the three different types of grass on the surface.
The SCG has hosted test cricket since 1882 and was the venue for hundreds of rugby league and union matches before the SFS was completed in 1988. It has also been the home of the Sydney Swans Australian Rules team since 1982.
Didulica said the presence of a cricket wicket on a playing surface presented "an unreasonable danger to the health and safety of footballers".
"It remains the view of the PFA that players are under no obligation to participate in matches when such risks are present. This includes the SCG."

Less than a month after theNew England Patriots won the Super Bowl, a group of Massachusetts lawmakers has proposed a bill that would ban organized youth tackle football until after seventh grade.
The bill, which moved to the Massachusetts legislaturesJoint Committee on Public Healththis week, follows unsuccessful attempts by legislators in five other states to pass similar measures to protect growing brains from traumatic injury.
The bipartisan bill, known asNo Hits, would impose financial penalties for any school league or other entity that does not comply.
There is significant science detailing repetitive head impacts have long-term neurological consequences, especially when they occur during brain development, one of the bills sponsors, Representative Paul A. Schmid III, a Democrat, said in a statement.
Although some medical professionals and former N.F.L. players have signaled their support for the measure andpublic opinion could buoy its prospects, the bill is already facing headwinds.
Two representatives who initially supported the measure have withdrawn their names from the bill, and a few other legislators said they would not support it.
Should we ban youth soccer too? asked Representative David Nangle, a Democrat who opposes the bill. Or youth hockey? When do we stop legislating into areas that we shouldnt be?
A spokeswoman for U.S.A. Football, whichgoverns youth football, said in a statement that the organization believes that decisions on allowing children to play football are best left to parents. To that end, she said, it has createda set of guidelinesdeveloped by leaders in athlete development and football.
The executive director of Pop Warner, Jon Butler, said in a statement that the organization had worked to improve player safety by eliminating the three-point stance and removing kickoffs for younger athletes. Banning football is not the answer, but we do agree that we should continue our efforts to make the game safer for our kids, he said.
Studiesby Boston Universityand other research centers have shown that children who began playing tackle football before the age of 12 were at greater risk for cognitive, mood and behavioral issues later in life, as well as conditions like chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.
But there has been opposition to those findings from the N.F.L. and even from well-intentioned parents, said Michael Kaplen, a lawyer whoteaches a legal course on traumatic brain injuryandtracks legislation governing youth tackle football. Mr. Kaplen said that there was no such thing as safer tackling and that a youth leagues promoting safer tackling would be similar to big tobacco companies offering low-nicotine cigarettes.
People dont understand that even a minor blow to the head has risks, he said. It may take years for these problems to become unmasked.
Steve Dembowski, 49, an executive board member of theMassachusetts High School Football Coaches Association, said parents, rather than the state, should be able to make choices for their children.
Considering that kids at that age get concussions playing soccer and baseball and any other sport where they can fall and hit their head on the ground, he said, it seems like an overstep of authority.
Damon Stanton, 43, has two sons who play football, and he coachesyouth football in Hanson, Mass., about 25 miles south of Boston.
I understand the concern, he said, citing the Boston University study. But he said more attention should be paid to the work that is being done to make the sport safer since the knuckle-dragging days when you would hit hit hit, and run until you were puking during practice.
He said his team had invested in new equipment, like foam tires that minimize player contact during practices, and introducedshoulder-tackling techniques developed byU.S.A. Football.
Mr. Stanton acknowledged that he might not be as influential as the Patriots head coach, Bill Belichick, adding that he is not a political guy.
But, he said, Ill definitely be calling my rep to let him know how I feel.
In recent years, tackle football has lost some of its luster among middle and high schoolers, and their parents. In 2017, about 2.4 million athletes from ages 6 to 17 regularly played the sport, down slightly from the year before, according tothe Sports & Fitness Industry Association. Rugby is gaining popularity because its tackling techniques appear less risky, whichincreasingly appeals to coaches who are leery of concussions.
There have been moves in some parts of the country to further address player safety for tackle football at the high school level. This month, the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Associationadopted new guidelinesintended to sharply reduce the amount of contact allowed during high school practices.
But several efforts last year to pass statewide legislation governing youth leagues werequashed by grass-roots movementsled by parents and coaches.
When Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle of New Jerseyproposed banning tackle football for children under 12, parents, coaches and players threatened to vote her out of office, she said in an email.
That bill is currently in limbo.
Unfortunately, the old boys club of politics and football go hand in hand, said Ms. Huttle, a Democrat. This bill has and will continue to receive pushback because it goes against the American grain.
A similar billin New York failed, and Californias Safe Football Act waspulled before a committee vote.The Dave Duerson Act, named after a Chicago Bears player who killed himself at age 50,did not make it past the Illinois legislature. And Marylands proposal, which also would have prohibited heading in soccer,was killed in committee.
These efforts, futile as they sometimes prove to be, still have a positive effect, supporters say.
I really did not expect it to pass, said Delegate Terri Hill, the Democratic legislator who sponsored Marylands bill.
But I think its a conversation we have to have, she said, and I dont think the conversation is over.
Representative Bradley H. Jones, a Republican who is a sponsor of the Massachusetts bill, echoed Ms. Hill.
Some football programs have already made changes indicating that there is at least some recognition of this problem, he said. If this bill does nothing else, I am hopeful that it starts a dialogue that will lead to the implementation of best practices and standards across the board to protect kids from long-term brain injuries.

LONDON  In the British capital, it is the calm before the storm. The countrys scheduled departure from the European Union  Brexit  is mere weeks away, although no deal has been reached. And so little is clear about what will become of Britain in the wake of its decision to Leave that many people seem resigned to the uncertainty of the moment. There is a tempest bearing down. But until then?
Until then, it is London Fashion Week, which wrapped up its biannual round on Tuesday.
Fashion is a multibillion-dollar industry in Britain, and a global one: It can neither afford to grind to a halt for Brexit nor afford to ignore it.
Theres nothing we can really do, Molly Goddard said after her show in answer to the inevitable questions. We have a lot of European partners but beyond that I dont really know. Ms. Goddards signature are many-tiered tulle dresses, candy-pink confections that can each require 200 feet or more of fabric  the lady as layer cake  but this season she showed them undergirded with trousers and boots beneath, and balaclavas above. Everything was meant to be stomped in, she said.
Like the Boy Scouts say: Be prepared. Ms. Goddard, whose dresses can look princess-y, has always understood that there is no inherent contradiction between sweetness and strength. Not for nothing is one of her most famous customers Villanelle, the deadly assassin in Killing Eve. (Never mind that Villanelles fictional.)

It is unfair to demand that designers reflect the politics of the moment in their work, and unfair to ask them to be spokespeople for the decisions of government ministers. Yet the question bubbled up again and again over the course of five days in London, in the backstage scrums where they faced the press and explained their work: Dont youhateBrexit? said a voice from the crowd that was facing down Riccardo Tisci, Burberrys chief creative officer, on Sunday under the hot, sharp glare of the lights at the Tate Modern following his second show for the brand.
I cannot answer, Mr. Tisci said. Everyone has a different opinion, of course.
But he had called his show Tempest. And he had just finished opining that we need the younger generation to be more free, and express themselves. He felt there had been greater freedom 20 years earlier, when he was studying at Central St. Martins. But two days before, London schoolchildren had skived off classes  Americans call it cutting, but the Britishism really captures the sense better to noisily protestinaction on climate change in the streets. It seemed Mr. Tisci was the less-free one, practicing the diplomatic parry of the corporate steward.

He has, after all, a behemoth to consider. Burberry aspires to be all things to all people, and Mr. Tisci ticked off the strength he felt the label deserves to have: not only fashion, but accessories, evening wear, streetwear, underwear, expensive clothes, affordable clothes. (All things being relative: Burberry T-shirts, like the one Mr. Tisci was wearing, can cost $390.)
To me, Burberry is lifestyle, he said. Its not a fashion label. It represents a lifestyle. And it represents a country.
With a remit that broad, it only makes sense that he based his collection on the idea of including, not excluding things. In the Tate, he divided his show space into two: one room, concrete, grimly lit, with chain-link fence; the other a kind of private theater with gleaming wood and cushioned seats. The tough and the posh.
He divided the collection along the same lines. There was a streetwear section of rugby shirts and puffers, trainers and track pants. Then came the bourgeois: the good old Burberry trench, fluty dresses, trailing scarves. (It would be nearly impossible to mistake one for the other, but if, say, you were viewing from space, the hair was the tell: gorgeous, elaborate curlicues more or less tattooed to the models foreheads for the street; sober, severe buns for the rest, snug in their own little nets.)
It had more sharpness and more bite thanMr. Tiscis first collection for Burberry, which was washed-out in a medley of dutiful beige. But it nevertheless had more of the attitudes of aggression (familiar to Mr. Tiscis fans from his years at Givenchy) than real snap. For all its enormous breadth, it felt more styled than meant, a tempest that would fit neatly in a teapot.
Mr. Tisci played with references of Cool Britannia, rave and chav (British for lout), and the vaunted DNA of Burberry  a word fashion executives love to use, in an eerily eugenic way. But the effort to be everything to everyone is enervating, and no doubt exhausting. Its no secret in the industry that lifestyle is the lifeblood of the business: Those that cant afford or cant wear luxury runway fashion have to be invited in with a T-shirt, a boxer brief, a perfume, a handbag, a keychain. But is that effort killing fashion?
Im sorry. Thats grouchy.
Its not Mr. Tiscis fault that fashion has grown so giant. Lifestyle is the general ambition.
It is clearly Victoria Beckhams. But then, shes already a lifestyle. Ms. Beckham is an icon in a truer sense of the word than is usually meant by the terms constant invocation  images of her are studied and revered  and she has built up a line offering women a way to dress like her.

This fall, after a trial run with Estée Lauder, she intends to introduce her own makeup collection. And at a preview at her studio in West London a few days before her show, she said that skin care will follow after that.
So when a bright red she called lipstick red rippled through the collection, you got what she was gesturing at. But it went down gently because Ms. Beckham delivered a collection, on a sunny Sunday morning at the Tate Britain, that was focused, appealing and, most importantly, real: suits and nipped-waist blazers, slouchy trousers and longish skirts, dresses and coats and muzzy knits that women could wear. Not only out but in: Into the office, into the lunch meeting, into the Tube.
We know my customer, Ms. Beckham said, and for a change, you believed it.

Fantasy predominates at fashion week, often fabulously so. When Joan Collins finally comes scampering into an Erdem show half an hour past its scheduled start gasping, I was stuck in the lift!, you pinch yourself. Is this a dream? When Christopher Kane designs a collection around balloon fetishists and latex kinksters, looners and rubberists, you pinch yourself  or worse. (Im not here to judge.)
But throughout London, the strongest impressions were made by clothes that seemed destined to go farther than the runway and Instagram, more life than lifestyle. No disrespect to the palliative power of fantasy but, with tempests on the horizon, the real way may be the wise way.
Away from the hamster wheel of hype are designers who have been working away steadily for decades, artists of the small detail and subtle tweak. Margaret Howell is one of those: After more than 40 years in business, she remains so discreet and so untroubled by the need for acclaim that you could spot her (if youcouldspot her) casually chatting, unrecognized, in the stairwell to her show space as dozens of guests there to see her show streamed obliviously past. But her collection was filled with pieces you would be glad to own, their proportions ever so slightly improved. Hussein Chalayan, who celebrateshis 25th anniversaryin business this year, is another: He has a wonderful way of reworking something you know  a white shirt, an unstructured blazer  into something recognizable but new, so you see it fresh.
Real women, real clothes. They were there at Simone Rocha, whose show was all the more affecting for its casting of models of different ages and different sizes, just as her real clients are. When Chloë Sevigny came ambling down the runway, smiling, it didnt feel like a stunt, any more than when Jeny Howorth or Jade Parfitt or Tess McMillan followed. Ms. Rochas collection has a place for them all.
And real clothes were at J.W. Anderson, who often strays into hinterlands of the esoteric. He didnt here, although he also didnt dull himself into normalcy either. Jonathan Anderson said he wanted to take the noise out and focus on clothing, and the collection was a reminder that he can: That behind the theatrics and the riddles that sometimes dog his efforts are often very good clothes. Here they were on dazzling display, in particular, his beautiful wrap coats and puddling trousers.

SYDNEY  Australia's players' union has joined Melbourne Victory boss Kevin Muscat in denouncing the "dangerous" Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) pitch after a player suffered a knee injury during an A-League match against Sydney FC on Saturday night.
Midfielder Terry Antonis fell to the ground untouched on the edge of the cricket square during a 2-1 loss for his side in a clash between the last two Australian champions.

James Kennedy wants you to know something about Rugby United New York right away. Were not the Knicks, he said.
Though New York Citys new professional rugby union team is an expansion team, he said, it will not wind up at the bottom of the standings like its basketball brother. Kennedy, the teams owner and chairman, did not hedge when he spoke about the teams chances in Major League Rugby. We are certainly playoff bound, he promised.
And why not? The team is 4-1, having played only road games so far in a 16-game season, and is ready for its home opener, against the Toronto Arrows, on Friday night at MCU Park in Coney Island.
New sports leagues  Major League Rugby is in its second year  have a habit of failing, and a professional rugby outfit would seem to be particularly perilous in a country where even many die-hard sports fans dont know a scrum from a line-out.
But Kennedy expects a good crowd on Friday and beyond. Id say well average 4,500, he said, adding that their first game in the 7,000-seat stadium was close to a sellout. The team could be helped by popular pricing: $20 to $35 a ticket.
With confidence, Kennedy added, Were looking for a bigger stadium for a playoff game. The top four finishers inthe nine-team leaguemake the playoffs.
The television box is checked. Fans not eager to jump on the D or F train can see many of the games on CBS Sports Network, SNY or ESPN+.
While rugby newcomers will hardly be turned away, Kennedy believes that a good chunk of the fans who turn up will be fairly savvy to the game. In the tristate area, there are 283 rugby clubs, he said. There are 35,000 players who started in college or high school. He expects the expatriate community to turn up, too.
He described the leagues business model as a direct copy of Major League Soccers. Kennedy owns his team and also a piece of the league. If a team or two fails, theres money to keep it on its feet and then move it after the season, he said.
Finding players for a rugby team in a football country required a multipronged approach. The team held four combines. One discovery was outside center Seimou Smith of New Haven, who started as a football player at Southern Connecticut State before shifting to rugby. The team has also recruited overseas.
That recruitment came easily, Kennedy said. Some big names reached out and wanted to come to New York. Thats the lure of the city, not me.
The team hired Mike Tolkin, a New Yorker who coached theUnited States national team and at Xavier High Schoolin Manhattan.
This only works if its a New York team, Kennedy said. We wanted to play within the city limits. If we find a New Yorker with 80 percent of the skills of a European, well take the New Yorker.
Players will make $20,000 to $35,000 for the four-and-a-half-month season. Kennedy said that of the squad of 34, eight or nine were also working full time, many as teachers.
One of those is Mike Petri, a scrum half and the team captain. A native Brooklynite who has played in three World Cups for the United States, he teaches science and coaches at Bay Ridge Prep in Brooklyn. They are very supportive, he said. Sometimes I go from coaching baseball or basketball straight to rugby practice.
Petri, 34, retired in 2015, but the lure of a professional league in the United States brought him back. The quality of play across the board is outstanding, he said, citing fullback Ben Foden, who has played for top club teams and the England national team.
Compared to the New York A.C., a semipro club Petri has played for, you get a high level of skill and a high rugby I.Q. Its a faster game.
Like Kennedy, Petri is bullish on the leagues future. Its an organic growth, he said. Were going to start with the existing fan base. The rugby community is so tight-knit. The thrill of being part of that group is tangible. And most people who watch their first rugby game are intrigued and get hooked.
And Kennedy has even bigger plans, arising in part from his background in construction. While acknowledging that options in the city are limited (just ask the New York City F.C. of M.L.S.), he said that in the longer term, I would love to build a stadium a few years from now.
For now, though, it will be all about defeating the likes of the Houston SaberCats and the Glendale Raptors and lifting the Major League Rugby trophy.

Facing a significant decline in the number of students playing high school football, the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association on Wednesday adopted new guidelines to sharply reduce the amount of contact allowed in practices and, in doing so, address concerns about player safety.
The new rules, which the association said were the most restrictive in the country, limits the time that teams can engage in full-contact drills in practice to 15 minutes a week, down from the 90 allowed under the old rules. Preseason full-contact drills, previously unlimited, will be reduced to six total hours, including scrimmages.
The existing ban on full contact in spring and summer practices in New Jersey remains in effect. New Jersey officials said that other states are considering similar restrictions as concerns about head injuries continue to grow.
I think this is a positive thing based on what we know now about player safety and the more education that we are all getting all the time about how to keep players healthy, said Kevin Carty Jr., the coach at Hillsborough High School in central New Jersey.
The New Jersey association said it implemented the rules on the recommendation of the New Jersey Football Coaches Association and Practice Like Pros, an organization that advocates the exact limits on practices that have now been adopted by New Jersey.
Full contact is considered tackling that brings a player to the ground.
Jesse Mez, an associate professor of neurology at Boston University and member of the schools Alzheimers Center and CTE Center, applauded the new regulations. He said that there is good evidence to show a relationship between the dangers of repetitive impacts in football  and not just those involving concussions  and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the degenerative disease linked to repeated blows to the head. He said the exact nature of that relationship has not been fully measured.
I think there are better ways of playing team sports and getting exercise than repeatedly hitting your head, Mez said. But given the countrys interest in football and how much everybody loves it, if we are not going to stop playing, then we should reduce the amount of contact as much as we can.
Despite its risks, tackle football is still among the most popular sports for male youths from ages 14 to 17. But participation is falling, and particularlyin New Jersey, a state long known for being rich in high school football talent.
In 2017, 1,700 fewer players were reported playing high school football in New Jersey than the year before, a 6.8 percent decrease. Only three states  Colorado, Montana and Oklahoma  lost players at a higher rate over the same period. Most attributed the decline to increased concerns about player safety.
Carty, a past president of the executive board of the New Jersey coaches association, said that while the purpose of the new rules was to increase safety, they also could help slow the decline in participation. He said he and a number of other coaches in New Jersey had been following the guidelines announced Wednesday for the past few seasons. Now, they will apply to everyone.
Were not doing this as a recruiting ploy, he said. Its just we want to keep our kids safe and we want people to know this is happening. By making it a mandate statewide, it can ease the fears of a lot of parents that they wont have to investigate that their coach is doing it the right way.
Other states moved to put new limits on out-of-game contact before New Jersey did. At least seven allow only 60 minutes of full-contact practice each week, and Texas has also worked to reduce head injuries by offering junior high school and high school coachesseminars on rugby tackling, where the focus is on leading with the shoulder instead of the head.
The N.C.A.A. does not mandate limits for its college football teams, offering only recommendations. The various conferences set their own limits, ranging from the Pacific-12, which allows 90 minutes a week, to the Ivy League, which does not allow any full-contact training.
The N.F.L. allows 14 padded practices during its 18-week regular season, and one practice per day for each day of preseason.
Terry ONeil, the founder of Practice Like Pros, said that his organization, which includes former N.F.L. players and coaches, neurosurgeons and orthopedists, is not concerned with participation levels. The goal is to promote the safety of those playing the game now. The approval of the New Jersey rules, he said, is going to be very helpful for us in opening the conversation with other states around the country.Supported by

SAPPORO, Japan  Japan captain Michael Leitch has accused some top tier nations of wanting to keep high level rugby to themselves after the Sunwolves, Japan's representatives in Super Rugby, were told they would be cut from the elite competition after the 2020 season.
The decision by organiser SANZAAR to revert to a purely southern hemisphere Super Rugby competition was a major blow for Japan and those who champion the growth of the game, as the nation prepares to showcase its development as hosts of the World Cup.
Leitch, who hasn't featured for the Sunwolves this season due to commitments with the national team, believes this is a mistake and that exposure to higher levels of competition is the only way to grow the sport he loves.
"It feels like the strong teams play within themselves and won't let anyone else in," Leitch said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday.
"The Japanese team, we need exposure and we need to be playing top, Tier One nations on a regular basis.
"I am very disappointed. The reason the national team now is making great steps towards beating quality sides is because we have got that exposure to a higher level."
Japan have made strides in recent years, following their famous victory over South Africa at the 2015 Rugby World Cup. They have recorded comfortable victories over Italy and Tonga and drawn with France in Paris.
ASIAN REPRESENTATIVES
The Sunwolves joined Super Rugby in 2016 as World Rugby looked to ramp up enthusiasm for the Rugby World Cup, which begins in Tokyo on Sept. 20.
World Rugby has insisted that hosting the first World Cup outside the sport's traditional heartland will boost the sport in Asia. But the decision to exclude the Sunwolves from the Super Rugby club competition appears to contradict that.
"To grow the game in Asia, we need the Sunwolves to be playing, and ideally we want the Sunwolves to be a team that all the Asian countries can look up to," argued Leitch.
"I think the Sunwolves was the key to expanding in Asia, playing in Singapore and Hong Kong ... but the powers who control the world clearly didn't see it like that."
There has been talk of a lucrative, competitive league being set-up in Japan following the World Cup, but the Japanese Rugby Football Union are yet to confirm any changes to the sport's structure.
One thing is for certain as far as Leitch is concerned: The current Top League structure will not produce players capable of challenging the established powers at the top of the international game.
"To be honest with you, Top League doesn't prepare you well for test matches," said Leitch.
"It will prepare you to beat Tier Two teams on a regular basis, but if you want to become a real formidable force in the world then you have got to be playing in the most competitive competition."
The Sunwolves, who have lost six of their eight matches this season, are next in Super Rugby action against the Hurricanes on April 19.

LONDON  In the British capital, it is the calm before the storm. The countrys scheduled departure from the European Union  Brexit  is mere weeks away, although no deal has been reached. And so little is clear about what will become of Britain in the wake of its decision to Leave that many people seem resigned to the uncertainty of the moment. There is a tempest bearing down. But until then?
Until then, it is London Fashion Week, which wrapped up its biannual round on Tuesday.
Fashion is a multibillion-dollar industry in Britain, and a global one: It can neither afford to grind to a halt for Brexit nor afford to ignore it.
Theres nothing we can really do, Molly Goddard said after her show in answer to the inevitable questions. We have a lot of European partners but beyond that I dont really know. Ms. Goddards signature are many-tiered tulle dresses, candy-pink confections that can each require 200 feet or more of fabric  the lady as layer cake  but this season she showed them undergirded with trousers and boots beneath, and balaclavas above. Everything was meant to be stomped in, she said.
Like the Boy Scouts say: Be prepared. Ms. Goddard, whose dresses can look princess-y, has always understood that there is no inherent contradiction between sweetness and strength. Not for nothing is one of her most famous customers Villanelle, the deadly assassin in Killing Eve. (Never mind that Villanelles fictional.)

It is unfair to demand that designers reflect the politics of the moment in their work, and unfair to ask them to be spokespeople for the decisions of government ministers. Yet the question bubbled up again and again over the course of five days in London, in the backstage scrums where they faced the press and explained their work: Dont youhateBrexit? said a voice from the crowd that was facing down Riccardo Tisci, Burberrys chief creative officer, on Sunday under the hot, sharp glare of the lights at the Tate Modern following his second show for the brand.
I cannot answer, Mr. Tisci said. Everyone has a different opinion, of course.
But he had called his show Tempest. And he had just finished opining that we need the younger generation to be more free, and express themselves. He felt there had been greater freedom 20 years earlier, when he was studying at Central St. Martins. But two days before, London schoolchildren had skived off classes  Americans call it cutting, but the Britishism really captures the sense better to noisily protestinaction on climate change in the streets. It seemed Mr. Tisci was the less-free one, practicing the diplomatic parry of the corporate steward.

He has, after all, a behemoth to consider. Burberry aspires to be all things to all people, and Mr. Tisci ticked off the strength he felt the label deserves to have: not only fashion, but accessories, evening wear, streetwear, underwear, expensive clothes, affordable clothes. (All things being relative: Burberry T-shirts, like the one Mr. Tisci was wearing, can cost $390.)
To me, Burberry is lifestyle, he said. Its not a fashion label. It represents a lifestyle. And it represents a country.
With a remit that broad, it only makes sense that he based his collection on the idea of including, not excluding things. In the Tate, he divided his show space into two: one room, concrete, grimly lit, with chain-link fence; the other a kind of private theater with gleaming wood and cushioned seats. The tough and the posh.
He divided the collection along the same lines. There was a streetwear section of rugby shirts and puffers, trainers and track pants. Then came the bourgeois: the good old Burberry trench, fluty dresses, trailing scarves. (It would be nearly impossible to mistake one for the other, but if, say, you were viewing from space, the hair was the tell: gorgeous, elaborate curlicues more or less tattooed to the models foreheads for the street; sober, severe buns for the rest, snug in their own little nets.)
It had more sharpness and more bite thanMr. Tiscis first collection for Burberry, which was washed-out in a medley of dutiful beige. But it nevertheless had more of the attitudes of aggression (familiar to Mr. Tiscis fans from his years at Givenchy) than real snap. For all its enormous breadth, it felt more styled than meant, a tempest that would fit neatly in a teapot.
Mr. Tisci played with references of Cool Britannia, rave and chav (British for lout), and the vaunted DNA of Burberry  a word fashion executives love to use, in an eerily eugenic way. But the effort to be everything to everyone is enervating, and no doubt exhausting. Its no secret in the industry that lifestyle is the lifeblood of the business: Those that cant afford or cant wear luxury runway fashion have to be invited in with a T-shirt, a boxer brief, a perfume, a handbag, a keychain. But is that effort killing fashion?
Im sorry. Thats grouchy.
Its not Mr. Tiscis fault that fashion has grown so giant. Lifestyle is the general ambition.
It is clearly Victoria Beckhams. But then, shes already a lifestyle. Ms. Beckham is an icon in a truer sense of the word than is usually meant by the terms constant invocation  images of her are studied and revered  and she has built up a line offering women a way to dress like her.

This fall, after a trial run with Estée Lauder, she intends to introduce her own makeup collection. And at a preview at her studio in West London a few days before her show, she said that skin care will follow after that.
So when a bright red she called lipstick red rippled through the collection, you got what she was gesturing at. But it went down gently because Ms. Beckham delivered a collection, on a sunny Sunday morning at the Tate Britain, that was focused, appealing and, most importantly, real: suits and nipped-waist blazers, slouchy trousers and longish skirts, dresses and coats and muzzy knits that women could wear. Not only out but in: Into the office, into the lunch meeting, into the Tube.
We know my customer, Ms. Beckham said, and for a change, you believed it.

Fantasy predominates at fashion week, often fabulously so. When Joan Collins finally comes scampering into an Erdem show half an hour past its scheduled start gasping, I was stuck in the lift!, you pinch yourself. Is this a dream? When Christopher Kane designs a collection around balloon fetishists and latex kinksters, looners and rubberists, you pinch yourself  or worse. (Im not here to judge.)
But throughout London, the strongest impressions were made by clothes that seemed destined to go farther than the runway and Instagram, more life than lifestyle. No disrespect to the palliative power of fantasy but, with tempests on the horizon, the real way may be the wise way.
Away from the hamster wheel of hype are designers who have been working away steadily for decades, artists of the small detail and subtle tweak. Margaret Howell is one of those: After more than 40 years in business, she remains so discreet and so untroubled by the need for acclaim that you could spot her (if youcouldspot her) casually chatting, unrecognized, in the stairwell to her show space as dozens of guests there to see her show streamed obliviously past. But her collection was filled with pieces you would be glad to own, their proportions ever so slightly improved. Hussein Chalayan, who celebrateshis 25th anniversaryin business this year, is another: He has a wonderful way of reworking something you know  a white shirt, an unstructured blazer  into something recognizable but new, so you see it fresh.
Real women, real clothes. They were there at Simone Rocha, whose show was all the more affecting for its casting of models of different ages and different sizes, just as her real clients are. When Chloë Sevigny came ambling down the runway, smiling, it didnt feel like a stunt, any more than when Jeny Howorth or Jade Parfitt or Tess McMillan followed. Ms. Rochas collection has a place for them all.
And real clothes were at J.W. Anderson, who often strays into hinterlands of the esoteric. He didnt here, although he also didnt dull himself into normalcy either. Jonathan Anderson said he wanted to take the noise out and focus on clothing, and the collection was a reminder that he can: That behind the theatrics and the riddles that sometimes dog his efforts are often very good clothes. Here they were on dazzling display, in particular, his beautiful wrap coats and puddling trousers.

Its tempting to think of Mr. Anderson floating above it all, especially when he said that he had designed his set, with its little rocks poking out of cream-colored carpet to suggest mountaintops poking through the clouds  as if his models were sailing over the sky, safe from the storm. But this was a much more grounded collection for Mr. Anderson, and all the better for it.
Shows like that put me in a good mood, Sidney Toledano, the chairman and chief executive of the LVMH Fashion Group, a minority stakeholder in the brand, whispered to Mr. Anderson.
Little else at the moment may be clear but this: I felt the same.

WELLINGTON  Australia and New South Wales fullback Israel Folau became the most prolific try-scorer in Super Rugby history on Saturday when he bagged his 60th career five-pointer against the Auckland Blues.
Folau tied the record of former All Blacks and Blues winger Doug Howlett in a victory over defending champions the Canterbury Crusaders two weeks ago and bettered the mark after 24 minutes of Saturday's match at Eden Park.
Long acknowledged as one of the best players in the world under the high ball, Folau leapt above two Blues defenders to snare Bernard Foley's crosskick and get his side back into the match after they had gone down 17-0 early on.
Folau, who celebrated his 30th birthday on Wednesday, later showed his ball-running skills to set up a try for team mate Alex Newsome but it was not enough to prevent the Waratahs losing 32-29.
The former rugby league international moved to rugby union with the Waratahs in 2013 after a spell in Australian Rules and has also scored 37 tries in 73 tests for the Wallabies.
Auckland native Howlett scored most of his 59 tries in nine seasons with the Blues from 1999 to 2007 after starting his Super Rugby career with the Otago Highlanders and Wellington Hurricanes.

WELLINGTON  Sam Cane has been cleared to return to contact training after breaking a bone in his neck and received another boost when he was invited to a one-day All Blacks camp, suggesting the flanker is still in coach Steve Hansen's Rugby World Cup thoughts.
Cane had to have an operation in South Africa after sustaining the injury playing against the Springboks in Pretoria last October and the 27-year-old has not played since.
However, his Waikato Chiefs coach Colin Cooper told reporters in Hamilton on Tuesday that he had been cleared for contact, just in time for the All Blacks' first 'foundation day' next Monday in Wellington.
The one-day camp, where the players undergo fitness testing and hold planning meetings, is one of three the All Blacks coaches have scheduled during the Super Rugby season as they fine tune plans for the World Cup in Japan later this year.
One for players based in the North Island will be held in Auckland on May 20, with another for South Island-based players in Christchurch on June 3.
New Zealand Rugby Head of High Performance Mike Anthony said in a media release that the "... foundation days will provide an opportunity for All Blacks management and our leading players to start building towards what is a huge year ahead".
Cane was among a handful of long-term injured players, including loose forward Liam Squire, scrumhalf Aaron Smith and winger Waisake Naholo, included in the initial 41-man planning squad.
All had been involved with the All Blacks, or their extended training squads, over the last two years, with Auckland Blues loose forward Akira Ioane the only player not to have appeared in a test match.
Former All Blacks centre Ma'a Nonu, who last appeared for the national side in the 2015 Rugby World Cup final, was not included.
Nonu had returned home for this year's Super Rugby season after three years in France and pundits had suggested he was keen to try to force his way back into national contention.

Less than a month after theNew England Patriots won the Super Bowl, a group of Massachusetts lawmakers has proposed a bill that would ban organized youth tackle football until after seventh grade.
The bill, which moved to the Massachusetts legislaturesJoint Committee on Public Healththis week, follows unsuccessful attempts by legislators in five other states to pass similar measures to protect growing brains from traumatic injury.
The bipartisan bill, known asNo Hits, would impose financial penalties for any school league or other entity that does not comply.
There is significant science detailing repetitive head impacts have long-term neurological consequences, especially when they occur during brain development, one of the bills sponsors, Representative Paul A. Schmid III, a Democrat, said in a statement.
Although some medical professionals and former N.F.L. players have signaled their support for the measure andpublic opinion could buoy its prospects, the bill is already facing headwinds.
Two representatives who initially supported the measure have withdrawn their names from the bill, and a few other legislators said they would not support it.
Should we ban youth soccer too? asked Representative David Nangle, a Democrat who opposes the bill. Or youth hockey? When do we stop legislating into areas that we shouldnt be?
A spokeswoman for U.S.A. Football, whichgoverns youth football, said in a statement that the organization believes that decisions on allowing children to play football are best left to parents. To that end, she said, it has createda set of guidelinesdeveloped by leaders in athlete development and football.
The executive director of Pop Warner, Jon Butler, said in a statement that the organization had worked to improve player safety by eliminating the three-point stance and removing kickoffs for younger athletes. Banning football is not the answer, but we do agree that we should continue our efforts to make the game safer for our kids, he said.
Studiesby Boston Universityand other research centers have shown that children who began playing tackle football before the age of 12 were at greater risk for cognitive, mood and behavioral issues later in life, as well as conditions like chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.
But there has been opposition to those findings from the N.F.L. and even from well-intentioned parents, said Michael Kaplen, a lawyer whoteaches a legal course on traumatic brain injuryandtracks legislation governing youth tackle football. Mr. Kaplen said that there was no such thing as safer tackling and that a youth leagues promoting safer tackling would be similar to big tobacco companies offering low-nicotine cigarettes.
People dont understand that even a minor blow to the head has risks, he said. It may take years for these problems to become unmasked.
Steve Dembowski, 49, an executive board member of theMassachusetts High School Football Coaches Association, said parents, rather than the state, should be able to make choices for their children.
Considering that kids at that age get concussions playing soccer and baseball and any other sport where they can fall and hit their head on the ground, he said, it seems like an overstep of authority.
Damon Stanton, 43, has two sons who play football, and he coachesyouth football in Hanson, Mass., about 25 miles south of Boston.
I understand the concern, he said, citing the Boston University study. But he said more attention should be paid to the work that is being done to make the sport safer since the knuckle-dragging days when you would hit hit hit, and run until you were puking during practice.
He said his team had invested in new equipment, like foam tires that minimize player contact during practices, and introducedshoulder-tackling techniques developed byU.S.A. Football.
Mr. Stanton acknowledged that he might not be as influential as the Patriots head coach, Bill Belichick, adding that he is not a political guy.
But, he said, Ill definitely be calling my rep to let him know how I feel.
In recent years, tackle football has lost some of its luster among middle and high schoolers, and their parents. In 2017, about 2.4 million athletes from ages 6 to 17 regularly played the sport, down slightly from the year before, according tothe Sports & Fitness Industry Association. Rugby is gaining popularity because its tackling techniques appear less risky, whichincreasingly appeals to coaches who are leery of concussions.
There have been moves in some parts of the country to further address player safety for tackle football at the high school level. This month, the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Associationadopted new guidelinesintended to sharply reduce the amount of contact allowed during high school practices.
But several efforts last year to pass statewide legislation governing youth leagues werequashed by grass-roots movementsled by parents and coaches.
When Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle of New Jerseyproposed banning tackle football for children under 12, parents, coaches and players threatened to vote her out of office, she said in an email.
That bill is currently in limbo.
Unfortunately, the old boys club of politics and football go hand in hand, said Ms. Huttle, a Democrat. This bill has and will continue to receive pushback because it goes against the American grain.
A similar billin New York failed, and Californias Safe Football Act waspulled before a committee vote.The Dave Duerson Act, named after a Chicago Bears player who killed himself at age 50,did not make it past the Illinois legislature. And Marylands proposal, which also would have prohibited heading in soccer,was killed in committee.
These efforts, futile as they sometimes prove to be, still have a positive effect, supporters say.
I really did not expect it to pass, said Delegate Terri Hill, the Democratic legislator who sponsored Marylands bill.
But I think its a conversation we have to have, she said, and I dont think the conversation is over.
Representative Bradley H. Jones, a Republican who is a sponsor of the Massachusetts bill, echoed Ms. Hill.
Some football programs have already made changes indicating that there is at least some recognition of this problem, he said. If this bill does nothing else, I am hopeful that it starts a dialogue that will lead to the implementation of best practices and standards across the board to protect kids from long-term brain injuries.Supported by

If you were trapped in a room and you had to break down the door to get out, you wouldnt hit that door with your head, says Rex Norris, who runs football for Atavus, a Seattle-based tackling consultancy that has worked with youth, high school, college and professional teams on shoulder-led tackling. After more than a decade of crisis and controversy over concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., American football organizations are looking to other sports like rugby and wrestling for alternative, lower-risk sacking methods. Never go into a tackle intending to hit with your head. Keep your head and neck out of the equation, Norris says. Last year, even the National Football League began penalizing players for helmet-led contact.
Get close before you strike. Decide which shoulder you intend to hit the person with, and then keep the foot on that side planted on the ground  if youre slamming with your left shoulder, for example, put your weight into the ball of your left foot as you make contact. Your power comes from your legs and feet, Norris says. Aim low: Ideally, your shoulder should hit your opponents thigh area, but consider anywhere between the pectoral muscles and the knees fair game. Square your body toward your opponent and, as you move forward, keep your elbows tucked in and your hands up, like a boxers. Maintain momentum after contact.
Finding newfangled ways to knock other humans down to the ground is something of a growth industry. The technique is not skill-specific, and its not age-specific, Norris says; in 2018, Atavus began providing mandatory shoulder-led tackling certification to all 23,000 high school and junior high school football coaches in Texas. Leaving your head out of a tackle isnt just a mind game, though; you need to do drills until muscle memory takes over. Players usually take to it quickly, but coaches tend to be more calcified in their ways. A quote Norris heard somewhere often comes to mind: Some coaches love winning so much theyre willing to change, and some coaches hate change so bad theyre willing to lose.

SYDNEY  Sydney FC's top of the table A-League clash against Perth Glory this month has been moved away from the Sydney Cricket Ground after a furore over the 'dangerous' pitch at the iconic stadium during the weekend.
Australia's players' union joined Melbourne Victory boss Kevin Muscat in slamming the SCG pitch after visiting midfielder Terry Antonis suffered a knee injury during a match against Sydney FC on Saturday night.
Head of Leagues Greg O'Rourke said that although the Football Federation Australia (FFA) considered the surface to be "playable and safe", the April 18 fixture would be moved to Jubilee Oval "in the best interests of all stakeholders".
"The SCG's (cricket) wicket block ... compromises the uniformity of the field for football in particular," he said in a joint statement with Sydney FC and the SCG.
Antonis fell to the ground untouched on the edge of the cricket square during a 2-1 loss for his side in a clash between the last two Australian champions.
Professional Footballers Australia (PFA) called for an independent investigation into how the match was allowed to go ahead given the 'deplorable state' of the pitch, which the body said posed a clear danger to player safety.
The SCG is being used by soccer, rugby league and rugby union teams in addition to hosting its usual cricket and Australian Rules matches while the neighbouring Sydney Football Stadium (SFS) is re-built.
Some 3,000 square metres of turf were relaid after the surface was torn up during a rugby union match last month.
Sydney FC travel to city rivals Western Sydney Wanderers next weekend but are assured of still being in second place behind Perth, who are six points clear at the top of the A-League, going into the match the following week.
"This is a hugely important fixture with first playing second and we want the narrative to be about the football," Sydney FC Chief Executive Danny Townsend said.
"This is a decision made in the viewing interest of members and supporters."
The SCG has hosted test cricket since 1882 and was the venue for hundreds of rugby league and union matches before the SFS was completed in 1988.

Facing a significant decline in the number of students playing high school football, the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association on Wednesday adopted new guidelines to sharply reduce the amount of contact allowed in practices and, in doing so, address concerns about player safety.
The new rules, which the association said were the most restrictive in the country, limits the time that teams can engage in full-contact drills in practice to 15 minutes a week, down from the 90 allowed under the old rules. Preseason full-contact drills, previously unlimited, will be reduced to six total hours, including scrimmages.
The existing ban on full contact in spring and summer practices in New Jersey remains in effect. New Jersey officials said that other states are considering similar restrictions as concerns about head injuries continue to grow.
I think this is a positive thing based on what we know now about player safety and the more education that we are all getting all the time about how to keep players healthy, said Kevin Carty Jr., the coach at Hillsborough High School in central New Jersey.
The New Jersey association said it implemented the rules on the recommendation of the New Jersey Football Coaches Association and Practice Like Pros, an organization that advocates the exact limits on practices that have now been adopted by New Jersey.
Full contact is considered tackling that brings a player to the ground.
Jesse Mez, an associate professor of neurology at Boston University and member of the schools Alzheimers Center and CTE Center, applauded the new regulations. He said that there is good evidence to show a relationship between the dangers of repetitive impacts in football  and not just those involving concussions  and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the degenerative disease linked to repeated blows to the head. He said the exact nature of that relationship has not been fully measured.
I think there are better ways of playing team sports and getting exercise than repeatedly hitting your head, Mez said. But given the countrys interest in football and how much everybody loves it, if we are not going to stop playing, then we should reduce the amount of contact as much as we can.
Despite its risks, tackle football is still among the most popular sports for male youths from ages 14 to 17. But participation is falling, and particularlyin New Jersey, a state long known for being rich in high school football talent.
In 2017, 1,700 fewer players were reported playing high school football in New Jersey than the year before, a 6.8 percent decrease. Only three states  Colorado, Montana and Oklahoma  lost players at a higher rate over the same period. Most attributed the decline to increased concerns about player safety.
Carty, a past president of the executive board of the New Jersey coaches association, said that while the purpose of the new rules was to increase safety, they also could help slow the decline in participation. He said he and a number of other coaches in New Jersey had been following the guidelines announced Wednesday for the past few seasons. Now, they will apply to everyone.
Were not doing this as a recruiting ploy, he said. Its just we want to keep our kids safe and we want people to know this is happening. By making it a mandate statewide, it can ease the fears of a lot of parents that they wont have to investigate that their coach is doing it the right way.
Other states moved to put new limits on out-of-game contact before New Jersey did. At least seven allow only 60 minutes of full-contact practice each week, and Texas has also worked to reduce head injuries by offering junior high school and high school coachesseminars on rugby tackling, where the focus is on leading with the shoulder instead of the head.
The N.C.A.A. does not mandate limits for its college football teams, offering only recommendations. The various conferences set their own limits, ranging from the Pacific-12, which allows 90 minutes a week, to the Ivy League, which does not allow any full-contact training.
The N.F.L. allows 14 padded practices during its 18-week regular season, and one practice per day for each day of preseason.
Terry ONeil, the founder of Practice Like Pros, said that his organization, which includes former N.F.L. players and coaches, neurosurgeons and orthopedists, is not concerned with participation levels. The goal is to promote the safety of those playing the game now. The approval of the New Jersey rules, he said, is going to be very helpful for us in opening the conversation with other states around the country.ByMatthew Schneier
LONDON  In the British capital, it is the calm before the storm. The countrys scheduled departure from the European Union  Brexit  is mere weeks away, although no deal has been reached. And so little is clear about what will become of Britain in the wake of its decision to Leave that many people seem resigned to the uncertainty of the moment. There is a tempest bearing down. But until then?
Until then, it is London Fashion Week, which wrapped up its biannual round on Tuesday.
Fashion is a multibillion-dollar industry in Britain, and a global one: It can neither afford to grind to a halt for Brexit nor afford to ignore it.
Theres nothing we can really do, Molly Goddard said after her show in answer to the inevitable questions. We have a lot of European partners but beyond that I dont really know. Ms. Goddards signature are many-tiered tulle dresses, candy-pink confections that can each require 200 feet or more of fabric  the lady as layer cake  but this season she showed them undergirded with trousers and boots beneath, and balaclavas above. Everything was meant to be stomped in, she said.
Like the Boy Scouts say: Be prepared. Ms. Goddard, whose dresses can look princess-y, has always understood that there is no inherent contradiction between sweetness and strength. Not for nothing is one of her most famous customers Villanelle, the deadly assassin in Killing Eve. (Never mind that Villanelles fictional.)

It is unfair to demand that designers reflect the politics of the moment in their work, and unfair to ask them to be spokespeople for the decisions of government ministers. Yet the question bubbled up again and again over the course of five days in London, in the backstage scrums where they faced the press and explained their work: Dont youhateBrexit? said a voice from the crowd that was facing down Riccardo Tisci, Burberrys chief creative officer, on Sunday under the hot, sharp glare of the lights at the Tate Modern following his second show for the brand.
I cannot answer, Mr. Tisci said. Everyone has a different opinion, of course.
But he had called his show Tempest. And he had just finished opining that we need the younger generation to be more free, and express themselves. He felt there had been greater freedom 20 years earlier, when he was studying at Central St. Martins. But two days before, London schoolchildren had skived off classes  Americans call it cutting, but the Britishism really captures the sense better to noisily protestinaction on climate change in the streets. It seemed Mr. Tisci was the less-free one, practicing the diplomatic parry of the corporate steward.

He has, after all, a behemoth to consider. Burberry aspires to be all things to all people, and Mr. Tisci ticked off the strength he felt the label deserves to have: not only fashion, but accessories, evening wear, streetwear, underwear, expensive clothes, affordable clothes. (All things being relative: Burberry T-shirts, like the one Mr. Tisci was wearing, can cost $390.)
To me, Burberry is lifestyle, he said. Its not a fashion label. It represents a lifestyle. And it represents a country.
With a remit that broad, it only makes sense that he based his collection on the idea of including, not excluding things. In the Tate, he divided his show space into two: one room, concrete, grimly lit, with chain-link fence; the other a kind of private theater with gleaming wood and cushioned seats. The tough and the posh.
He divided the collection along the same lines. There was a streetwear section of rugby shirts and puffers, trainers and track pants. Then came the bourgeois: the good old Burberry trench, fluty dresses, trailing scarves. (It would be nearly impossible to mistake one for the other, but if, say, you were viewing from space, the hair was the tell: gorgeous, elaborate curlicues more or less tattooed to the models foreheads for the street; sober, severe buns for the rest, snug in their own little nets.)
It had more sharpness and more bite thanMr. Tiscis first collection for Burberry, which was washed-out in a medley of dutiful beige. But it nevertheless had more of the attitudes of aggression (familiar to Mr. Tiscis fans from his years at Givenchy) than real snap. For all its enormous breadth, it felt more styled than meant, a tempest that would fit neatly in a teapot.
Mr. Tisci played with references of Cool Britannia, rave and chav (British for lout), and the vaunted DNA of Burberry  a word fashion executives love to use, in an eerily eugenic way. But the effort to be everything to everyone is enervating, and no doubt exhausting. Its no secret in the industry that lifestyle is the lifeblood of the business: Those that cant afford or cant wear luxury runway fashion have to be invited in with a T-shirt, a boxer brief, a perfume, a handbag, a keychain. But is that effort killing fashion?
Im sorry. Thats grouchy.
Its not Mr. Tiscis fault that fashion has grown so giant. Lifestyle is the general ambition.
It is clearly Victoria Beckhams. But then, shes already a lifestyle. Ms. Beckham is an icon in a truer sense of the word than is usually meant by the terms constant invocation  images of her are studied and revered  and she has built up a line offering women a way to dress like her.

This fall, after a trial run with Estée Lauder, she intends to introduce her own makeup collection. And at a preview at her studio in West London a few days before her show, she said that skin care will follow after that.
So when a bright red she called lipstick red rippled through the collection, you got what she was gesturing at. But it went down gently because Ms. Beckham delivered a collection, on a sunny Sunday morning at the Tate Britain, that was focused, appealing and, most importantly, real: suits and nipped-waist blazers, slouchy trousers and longish skirts, dresses and coats and muzzy knits that women could wear. Not only out but in: Into the office, into the lunch meeting, into the Tube.
We know my customer, Ms. Beckham said, and for a change, you believed it.

Fantasy predominates at fashion week, often fabulously so. When Joan Collins finally comes scampering into an Erdem show half an hour past its scheduled start gasping, I was stuck in the lift!, you pinch yourself. Is this a dream? When Christopher Kane designs a collection around balloon fetishists and latex kinksters, looners and rubberists, you pinch yourself  or worse. (Im not here to judge.)
But throughout London, the strongest impressions were made by clothes that seemed destined to go farther than the runway and Instagram, more life than lifestyle. No disrespect to the palliative power of fantasy but, with tempests on the horizon, the real way may be the wise way.
Away from the hamster wheel of hype are designers who have been working away steadily for decades, artists of the small detail and subtle tweak. Margaret Howell is one of those: After more than 40 years in business, she remains so discreet and so untroubled by the need for acclaim that you could spot her (if youcouldspot her) casually chatting, unrecognized, in the stairwell to her show space as dozens of guests there to see her show streamed obliviously past. But her collection was filled with pieces you would be glad to own, their proportions ever so slightly improved. Hussein Chalayan, who celebrateshis 25th anniversaryin business this year, is another: He has a wonderful way of reworking something you know  a white shirt, an unstructured blazer  into something recognizable but new, so you see it fresh.
Real women, real clothes. They were there at Simone Rocha, whose show was all the more affecting for its casting of models of different ages and different sizes, just as her real clients are. When Chloë Sevigny came ambling down the runway, smiling, it didnt feel like a stunt, any more than when Jeny Howorth or Jade Parfitt or Tess McMillan followed. Ms. Rochas collection has a place for them all.
And real clothes were at J.W. Anderson, who often strays into hinterlands of the esoteric. He didnt here, although he also didnt dull himself into normalcy either. Jonathan Anderson said he wanted to take the noise out and focus on clothing, and the collection was a reminder that he can: That behind the theatrics and the riddles that sometimes dog his efforts are often very good clothes. Here they were on dazzling display, in particular, his beautiful wrap coats and puddling trousers.

Its tempting to think of Mr. Anderson floating above it all, especially when he said that he had designed his set, with its little rocks poking out of cream-colored carpet to suggest mountaintops poking through the clouds  as if his models were sailing over the sky, safe from the storm. But this was a much more grounded collection for Mr. Anderson, and all the better for it.
Shows like that put me in a good mood, Sidney Toledano, the chairman and chief executive of the LVMH Fashion Group, a minority stakeholder in the brand, whispered to Mr. Anderson.
Little else at the moment may be clear but this: I felt the same.

Less than a month after theNew England Patriots won the Super Bowl, a group of Massachusetts lawmakers has proposed a bill that would ban organized youth tackle football until after seventh grade.
The bill, which moved to the Massachusetts legislaturesJoint Committee on Public Healththis week, follows unsuccessful attempts by legislators in five other states to pass similar measures to protect growing brains from traumatic injury.
The bipartisan bill, known asNo Hits, would impose financial penalties for any school league or other entity that does not comply.
There is significant science detailing repetitive head impacts have long-term neurological consequences, especially when they occur during brain development, one of the bills sponsors, Representative Paul A. Schmid III, a Democrat, said in a statement.
Although some medical professionals and former N.F.L. players have signaled their support for the measure andpublic opinion could buoy its prospects, the bill is already facing headwinds.
Two representatives who initially supported the measure have withdrawn their names from the bill, and a few other legislators said they would not support it.
Should we ban youth soccer too? asked Representative David Nangle, a Democrat who opposes the bill. Or youth hockey? When do we stop legislating into areas that we shouldnt be?
A spokeswoman for U.S.A. Football, whichgoverns youth football, said in a statement that the organization believes that decisions on allowing children to play football are best left to parents. To that end, she said, it has createda set of guidelinesdeveloped by leaders in athlete development and football.
The executive director of Pop Warner, Jon Butler, said in a statement that the organization had worked to improve player safety by eliminating the three-point stance and removing kickoffs for younger athletes. Banning football is not the answer, but we do agree that we should continue our efforts to make the game safer for our kids, he said.
Studiesby Boston Universityand other research centers have shown that children who began playing tackle football before the age of 12 were at greater risk for cognitive, mood and behavioral issues later in life, as well as conditions like chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.
But there has been opposition to those findings from the N.F.L. and even from well-intentioned parents, said Michael Kaplen, a lawyer whoteaches a legal course on traumatic brain injuryandtracks legislation governing youth tackle football. Mr. Kaplen said that there was no such thing as safer tackling and that a youth leagues promoting safer tackling would be similar to big tobacco companies offering low-nicotine cigarettes.
People dont understand that even a minor blow to the head has risks, he said. It may take years for these problems to become unmasked.
Steve Dembowski, 49, an executive board member of theMassachusetts High School Football Coaches Association, said parents, rather than the state, should be able to make choices for their children.
Considering that kids at that age get concussions playing soccer and baseball and any other sport where they can fall and hit their head on the ground, he said, it seems like an overstep of authority.
Damon Stanton, 43, has two sons who play football, and he coachesyouth football in Hanson, Mass., about 25 miles south of Boston.
I understand the concern, he said, citing the Boston University study. But he said more attention should be paid to the work that is being done to make the sport safer since the knuckle-dragging days when you would hit hit hit, and run until you were puking during practice.
He said his team had invested in new equipment, like foam tires that minimize player contact during practices, and introducedshoulder-tackling techniques developed byU.S.A. Football.
Mr. Stanton acknowledged that he might not be as influential as the Patriots head coach, Bill Belichick, adding that he is not a political guy.
But, he said, Ill definitely be calling my rep to let him know how I feel.
In recent years, tackle football has lost some of its luster among middle and high schoolers, and their parents. In 2017, about 2.4 million athletes from ages 6 to 17 regularly played the sport, down slightly from the year before, according tothe Sports & Fitness Industry Association. Rugby is gaining popularity because its tackling techniques appear less risky, whichincreasingly appeals to coaches who are leery of concussions.
There have been moves in some parts of the country to further address player safety for tackle football at the high school level. This month, the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Associationadopted new guidelinesintended to sharply reduce the amount of contact allowed during high school practices.
But several efforts last year to pass statewide legislation governing youth leagues werequashed by grass-roots movementsled by parents and coaches.
When Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle of New Jerseyproposed banning tackle football for children under 12, parents, coaches and players threatened to vote her out of office, she said in an email.
That bill is currently in limbo.
Unfortunately, the old boys club of politics and football go hand in hand, said Ms. Huttle, a Democrat. This bill has and will continue to receive pushback because it goes against the American grain.

CAPE TOWN  Coach Gary Gold said Major League Rugby (MLR) will help the United States be more competitive at the World Cup in Japan, but conceded we might only see the best of his side in four years' time.
The U.S. begin their campaign against England on Sept. 26, followed by meetings with France, Argentina and Tonga in Pool C, where they are the lowest ranked team.
South African Gold was assistant coach for the Springboks at the 2011 World Cup and is realistic about his side's prospects.
However, he believes regular game-time for players in MLR, a nine-team professional domestic championship which started last year, has been a game-changer and will continue to be felt in years to come.
"It is critical, there is no doubt that it was a contributor to our wins over Scotland, Samoa and Canada recently," Gold told Reuters in a telephone interview.
"The players will come into our first camp, which starts in mid-June, having played four or five months of rugby week in, week out.
"Over and above that, it is that tier of player that has not got a contract in France, England or elsewhere, who previously has not been in that professional environment where you train and gym regularly, understand the nutritional requirements and so on.
"In years gone by, we might have had players who would come to camp without having even trained in four months, let alone played matches. So it is massive for us."
The U.S. will take part in the Pacific Nations Cup in July-August along with hosts Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Canada and Japan, and are also seeking a pre-World Cup friendly after a proposed fixture against Australia fell away.
"The Nations Cup will be a really good dress rehearsal for us, travelling to Fiji and playing good quality opposition. Our team-building camps will be based around the Denver area, where we are looking for hot temperatures and high altitude," Gold said.
Wins over Scotland and Samoa in the last 12 months were the first against a tier one nation since victory over France in 1924. While Gold said it proves the competitiveness of his side, it means little if they cannot perform at that level regularly.
"It's good to know that when everything clicks and we do what we set out to do, we can be competitive against tier one teams," he added.
"But we cannot get ahead of ourselves, unless we can replicate those results on a consistent basis we are not really moving forward how we would like to."
'SMART RUGBY'
At the same time, Gold concedes that seeing improvement on the pitch is perhaps more important than the results in Japan, and that the potential strides forward in U.S. rugby may only be seen at the World Cup in France in four years' time.
"From an 'optics' point of view, I am slightly less worried about the results and more about whether we can, at this moment, go out and show we can compete," he said.
"If the by-product of that is we can nick a couple of wins, that would be fantastic, but for me it is about the performances.
"We are not favourites to win any of our games in Japan, but we want to go there and feel like we have given it our best shot and played some smart rugby.
"We have three 19-year-olds in our provisional squad, and as well as others under the age of 23, and in France in four years' time this group could have added another 300 or 400 cumulative caps.
"If that is the case, we will be a lot more experienced and better off."

SAPPORO, Japan  Australia's most capped player George Gregan has backed the Wallabies to surprise a few people at this year's Rugby World Cup if they can overcome the inconsistencies that have plagued them for the last three years.
The Wallabies endured their worst test campaign in 60 years in 2018, winning four out of 13 matches and slumping to sixth in the world rankings.
However, former scrumhalf Gregan, who scored 99 points in 139 internationals, believes Michael Cheika's men can peak come tournament time in September, just as they did in 2015 when they reached the final.
"They do have time in a World Cup year, which is a unique year. It is about getting it right when you get over here," said Gregan in an interview with Reuters in Sapporo.
"I just see the margins now, particularly amongst the top eight teams, getting smaller and smaller.
"They can flip that switch, they have that in them."
However, Gregan, who is in Japan in his role as ambassador for World Cup sponsor Land Rover, warned that Cheika's men will have to show improvement in the reduced Rugby Championship that begins in July to then be serious contenders at the right time.
"It's about getting it right on the day and if you are a little bit off, you are out. That is the Rugby World Cup," the 45-year-old said.
WELSH EXAMPLE
He also pointed to the consistency shown by Australia's World Cup Pool D opponents Wales in their recent winning run, which included winning the Six Nations Grand Slam last month.
"You have a team like Wales, who have won 14 in a row... all the fundamentals of their game are sound and together but the Wallabies team haven't had that for a while," said Gregan.
"I think they (Australia) have just been inconsistent, really inconsistent. They have shown glimpses of what they can do...
"The ability to score points is in that group because they have some world class players; Will Genia, Israel Folau, Samu Kerevi is developing into a really good international centre.
"You can see parts of their game improving, but they haven't put it all together at the same time for an extended period and that is what consistent, good teams do."
Gregan, who won the 1999 World Cup with Australia, has seen his country reach the final on four occasions and said they might even enjoy being seen as underdogs later this year.
"We like going to international competitions and especially if the Wallabies are a little bit under the radar then they can go about their work and do a good block of training... then they will think why not?," he said.
"Sure, we have been inconsistent for three years but it is a seven week tournament and it is a special animal, the Rugby World Cup."
The World Cup begins in Tokyo on Sept. 20 when hosts Japan face Russia.

SYDNEY  Australia's players' union has joined Melbourne Victory boss Kevin Muscat in denouncing the "dangerous" Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) pitch after a player suffered a knee injury during an A-League match against Sydney FC on Saturday night.
Midfielder Terry Antonis fell to the ground untouched on the edge of the cricket square during a 2-1 loss for his side in a clash between the last two Australian champions.
The iconic ground is being used for football codes while the neighbouring Sydney Football Stadium is re-vamped and has already attracted criticism after it was torn up during a rugby match.
"It was dangerous, first and foremost," Muscat told reporters.
"To ask players to come and work under those conditions is unacceptable. It might be a serious injury as a result from it. And for players to go out onto that, whatever it's called, is a disgrace."
Professional Footballers Australia (PFA) called for an independent investigation into how the match was allowed to go ahead given the "deplorable state" of the pitch, which the body said posed a "clear danger" to "player safety".
"The players confirmed with us last night that they were not consulted at any stage on whether or not the match should proceed, notwithstanding the clear issues that the pitch presented to their livelihoods," chief executive John Didulica said in a statement.
"The PFA will ... recommend two clear resolutions for adoption. Firstly, that FFA immediately commission an independent investigation into the process undertaken to approve last night's match as being fit for play.
"Secondly, endorse a motion that players will no longer play on surfaces unacceptably compromised by a cricket wicket."
Sydney FC, whose victory kept them second in the A-League, are scheduled to host league leaders Perth Glory at the ground on April 18.
"The pitch clearly wasn't up to the standards required for professional football and we are working with the SCG Trust and FFA to assess its suitability to host our game against Perth in 11 days' time," said Sydney FC chief executive Danny Townsend.
"All options are on the table, including moving the game, and those discussions are already underway."

SYDNEY  Australia's players' union has joined Melbourne Victory boss Kevin Muscat in denouncing the "dangerous" Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) pitch after a player suffered a knee injury during an A-League match against Sydney FC on Saturday night.
Midfielder Terry Antonis fell to the ground untouched on the edge of the cricket square during a 2-1 loss for his side in a clash between the last two Australian champions.
The iconic ground is being used for football codes while the neighbouring Sydney Football Stadium is re-vamped and has already attracted criticism after it was torn up during a rugby match.
"It was dangerous, first and foremost," Muscat told reporters.
"To ask players to come and work under those conditions is unacceptable. It might be a serious injury as a result from it. And for players to go out onto that, whatever it's called, is a disgrace."
Professional Footballers Australia (PFA) called for an independent investigation into how the match was allowed to go ahead given the "deplorable state" of the pitch, which the body said posed a "clear danger" to "player safety".
"The players confirmed with us last night that they were not consulted at any stage on whether or not the match should proceed, notwithstanding the clear issues that the pitch presented to their livelihoods," chief executive John Didulica said in a statement.
"The PFA will ... recommend two clear resolutions for adoption. Firstly, that FFA immediately commission an independent investigation into the process undertaken to approve last night's match as being fit for play.
"Secondly, endorse a motion that players will no longer play on surfaces unacceptably compromised by a cricket wicket."
Football Federation Australia (FFA) will meet with Sydney FC and the Sydney Cricket Ground management on Monday to discuss the condition of the playing surface.
"If we're not confident that the ground will improve significantly then alternate venues would be sought in the future for Sydney FC home matches," A-League head Greg O'Rourke said in a statement.
"Whilst FFA understands the current demands on the surface...it appears that the needs of our code around surface condition may not be able to be met, despite the best intentions of all parties."
O'Rourke also said they would review the decision to play Saturday's game.
Sydney FC, whose victory kept them second in the A-League, are scheduled to host league leaders Perth Glory at the ground on April 18.
"The pitch clearly wasn't up to the standards required for professional football and we are working with the SCG Trust and FFA to assess its suitability to host our game against Perth in 11 days' time," said Sydney FC chief executive Danny Townsend.
"All options are on the table, including moving the game, and those discussions are already underway."

WELLINGTON  There were no knights riding around the pitch beforehand but it was business as usual on the scoreboard as the Canterbury Crusaders rallied to thrash the ACT Brumbies 36-14 on Saturday in their first home match since the Christchurch shootings.
The nine-times Super Rugby champions trailed 7-0 at halftime but two tries each from wingers Sevu Reece and Will Jordan as well as a five-pointer from flanker Jordan Taufua after the break safely secured the bonus point win.
The victory extended their unbeaten streak at home to 23 matches and allowed the defending champions to stretch their lead at the top of the New Zealand conference to six points, while the Brumbies slumped to a fifth loss in seven matches.
Because of the associations with the medieval religious wars between Christians and Muslims, the Crusaders have embarked on a review of their name and branding in the wake of the shootings at two mosques on March 15 that killed 50 people.
In the meantime, they have also suspended the 23-year pre-match tradition of sword-toting horsemen dressed in chainmail riding around the periphery of the pitch to rally the crowd.
There was not facade of a castle at pitchside either but the ground, where the Crusaders have played since the 2011 earthquake flattened much of Christchurch and rendered their old stadium unsafe, has long been a fortress in rugby terms.
The Brumbies had not won in Christchurch in a decade but gave as good as they got in a frenetic first half without managing initially to breach the home try line, lock Murray Douglas coming closest only to spill the ball.
Crusaders prop Owen Franks, playing his 150th Super Rugby match, was sin-binned for a "no arms" tackle in the 27th minute, however, and Brumbies captain Christian Lealiifano finally found a crack in the red defensive line to cross six minutes later.
Reece took only four minutes after the break to score the converted try that levelled up the scores and a further 10 minutes later Jordan crossed in the corner for his first.
Brumbies winger Toni Pulu was shown the yellow card for a high tackle as he tried to stop the score and Jordan crossed again only three minutes later after a searing break up the middle from flyhalf Richie Mo'unga.
No sooner had Pulu returned than Brumbies lock Sam Carter was sin-binned for a similar offence and replacement Taufua made the most of the extra space to go over under the posts.
Reece scored his second off an interception two minutes later and when Wallabies centre Tevita Kuridrani finished off a 90 metre move for a second try for the visitors three minutes from time, it was only going to be a consolation.

MELBOURNE  Australian outside back Jack Maddocks is trying hard not to think about wearing the Wallabies jersey at the upcoming World Cup but it is getting more difficult every time he crosses the try-line for the Melbourne Rebels.
The talented 22-year-old, who made his test debut last year, grabbed two tries in the win over the Queensland Reds last weekend to lead Super Rugby with eight from six games.
His rollicking start to the season has put him among the players first picked by pundits tipping the make-up of Michael Cheika's squad for Japan but the man affectionately nicknamed "Mad Dog" is determined not to get ahead of himself.
"Obviously it's the pinnacle of rugby. So growing up, I always watched the World Cup, whenever it was on," he told reporters in Melbourne on Friday.
"This year I haven't put much thought to it, to be honest. I think I'm sort of one of those people that gets motivated by day-to-day things. If I look to far ahead I sort of get off track.
"My sole focus so far has just been on the Rebels."
An imposing 6ft-4in in height and very quick, Maddocks won his first test cap off the bench against the All Blacks in Sydney last year, got his first start in the return match in Auckland and featured in seven tests in all.
Despite his personal breakthrough, it was a grim start to his international career, with the team losing six of those matches and nine out of 13 for the season.
Maddocks has enjoyed more team success at provincial level, with the Rebels enjoying rare air at the top of the Australian Conference with four wins from six games.
Former Wallabies flyhalf Quade Cooper has been key in the positive start for the Rebels and Maddocks, and he set up both his team mate's tries against the Reds with deft kicking.
With Cooper also in good form since reuniting with scrumhalf Will Genia, his old Queensland Reds mucker, it's not too much of a stretch to see the three Rebels combining in Japan.
Maddocks said there was little planning behind the mercurial Cooper's array of cross-field kicks and other tricks.
"I think he's just sort of one of those instinctual players where he has the feel for the game and can feel where you are," Maddocks said of the 70-test Wallaby.
"It probably looks a lot more planned that it is.
"We just sort of connect up pretty naturally."
Maddocks will look to add to his try tally at home on Saturday against the Tokyo-based Sunwolves, who have claimed pioneering wins in New Zealand and in Australia this season, felling the New South Wales Waratahs in Sydney last week.
The Sunwolves play a similar brand of running rugby to the Rebels and Maddocks said that would suit his team just fine.
"They've got a few really good kickers in their side," he said.
"They'll probably put us to work in the backfield but I think that sort of suits us because we get the ball and get to play and that excites us."

TOULOUSE, France  Former France coach Guy Noves is entitled to one million euros (£862,415) in compensation for wrongful dismissal by the national rugby federation, a French court said on Monday.
The FFR alleged Noves was guilty of serious misconduct, but a Toulouse labour tribunal decided otherwise. Noves was asking for 2.88 million euros.
Both parties have the right to appeal, although initial reactions suggested that they had accepted the outcome.
"I am satisfied with this decision. The FFR said there was serious misconduct and the tribunal said there was none," Noves, the first France rugby union coach to be sacked, told reporters.
"I don't know if we are going to appeal, we have a month to do so. The demands (from Noves) were excessive and the decision is reasonable," the FFR's lawyer Joseph Aguera told French sports newspaper L'Equipe.
The FFR later welcomed a "balanced" decision and said in a statement it did not plan to appeal.
Noves was sacked by the FFR in December 2017 after winning seven of his 21 matches in charge, while his contract was due to run until the end of this year's World Cup in Japan.
Noves, 65, was replaced by Jacques Brunel, who has been struggling to turn the situation around.
France beat Scotland and Italy in this year's Six Nations but lost against England, Ireland and Wales to finish fourth.

If you were trapped in a room and you had to break down the door to get out, you wouldnt hit that door with your head, says Rex Norris, who runs football for Atavus, a Seattle-based tackling consultancy that has worked with youth, high school, college and professional teams on shoulder-led tackling. After more than a decade of crisis and controversy over concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., American football organizations are looking to other sports like rugby and wrestling for alternative, lower-risk sacking methods. Never go into a tackle intending to hit with your head. Keep your head and neck out of the equation, Norris says. Last year, even the National Football League began penalizing players for helmet-led contact.
Get close before you strike. Decide which shoulder you intend to hit the person with, and then keep the foot on that side planted on the ground  if youre slamming with your left shoulder, for example, put your weight into the ball of your left foot as you make contact. Your power comes from your legs and feet, Norris says. Aim low: Ideally, your shoulder should hit your opponents thigh area, but consider anywhere between the pectoral muscles and the knees fair game. Square your body toward your opponent and, as you move forward, keep your elbows tucked in and your hands up, like a boxers. Maintain momentum after contact.
Finding newfangled ways to knock other humans down to the ground is something of a growth industry. The technique is not skill-specific, and its not age-specific, Norris says; in 2018, Atavus began providing mandatory shoulder-led tackling certification to all 23,000 high school and junior high school football coaches in Texas. Leaving your head out of a tackle isnt just a mind game, though; you need to do drills until muscle memory takes over. Players usually take to it quickly, but coaches tend to be more calcified in their ways. A quote Norris heard somewhere often comes to mind: Some coaches love winning so much theyre willing to change, and some coaches hate change so bad theyre willing to lose.

WELLINGTON  All Blacks fullback Israel Dagg has retired from all rugby at the age of 30 after struggling with a long-term knee injury, he said on Friday.
World Cup winner Dagg, who played the last of his 66 tests on the wing against Argentina in 2017, decided to call time on his career after receiving medical advice.
"As a little kid growing up in Hawkes bay I never in my wildest dreams thought I would have travelled the road I have with Rugby," Dagg said in a post on Instagram.
"Unfortunately my dream career has come to an end due to a increasingly painful and unfixable right knee, my rugby days are over."
One of a raft of brilliant outside backs brought into the All Blacks side by Graham Henry, Dagg made his test debut against Ireland at the age of 22 and played a starring role in the side's 2011 World Cup triumph the following year.
Dagg scored five tries in five matches in the tournament and started at fullback in the final against France.
Blessed with searing pace, skill and vision, Dagg scored 26 tries in all for the All Blacks and set up countless others through a sparkling eight-year international career.
He also played a total of 112 Super Rugby matches for the Otago Highlanders and the Canterbury Crusaders, claiming back-to-back titles with the latter in 2017-18.
Dagg suffered a season-ending knee injury in his final test in 2017 and managed only a handful of appearances for the Crusaders during their successful title defence last year.
He said he would continue at the reigning Super Rugby champions in a mentoring role for the rest of the season.
"While it's bittersweet to mark the end of my playing career, I'm grateful to still be able to contribute to this Crusaders team in 2019 and help prepare some of the younger squad members to take the next step in their own careers," he said in a New Zealand Rugby media release.
"On a personal note, I'm looking forward to taking on some new challenges in the future, and looking forward to spending more time with my young family."
New Zealand's rugby community paid tribute to a player who started in 63 of his 66 tests and played 49 at fullback, second only to Mils Muliaina in the position.
"It's always a shame when injury forces a player to retire, but 'Izzy' will leave our game knowing that he'll forever be remembered as an outstanding player who definitely enhanced the All Blacks jersey and contributed to the legacy of the team," All Blacks coach Steve Hansen said.
"We'll all miss his outstanding rugby skills on the field, but he was a real character off the field as well.We'll look back fondly at his time in the black jersey - he's a very special man and a very special player."

Facing a significant decline in the number of students playing high school football, the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association on Wednesday adopted new guidelines to sharply reduce the amount of contact allowed in practices and, in doing so, address concerns about player safety.
The new rules, which the association said were the most restrictive in the country, limits the time that teams can engage in full-contact drills in practice to 15 minutes a week, down from the 90 allowed under the old rules. Preseason full-contact drills, previously unlimited, will be reduced to six total hours, including scrimmages.
The existing ban on full contact in spring and summer practices in New Jersey remains in effect. New Jersey officials said that other states are considering similar restrictions as concerns about head injuries continue to grow.
I think this is a positive thing based on what we know now about player safety and the more education that we are all getting all the time about how to keep players healthy, said Kevin Carty Jr., the coach at Hillsborough High School in central New Jersey.
The New Jersey association said it implemented the rules on the recommendation of the New Jersey Football Coaches Association and Practice Like Pros, an organization that advocates the exact limits on practices that have now been adopted by New Jersey.
Full contact is considered tackling that brings a player to the ground.
Jesse Mez, an associate professor of neurology at Boston University and member of the schools Alzheimers Center and CTE Center, applauded the new regulations. He said that there is good evidence to show a relationship between the dangers of repetitive impacts in football  and not just those involving concussions  and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the degenerative disease linked to repeated blows to the head. He said the exact nature of that relationship has not been fully measured.
I think there are better ways of playing team sports and getting exercise than repeatedly hitting your head, Mez said. But given the countrys interest in football and how much everybody loves it, if we are not going to stop playing, then we should reduce the amount of contact as much as we can.
Despite its risks, tackle football is still among the most popular sports for male youths from ages 14 to 17. But participation is falling, and particularlyin New Jersey, a state long known for being rich in high school football talent.
In 2017, 1,700 fewer players were reported playing high school football in New Jersey than the year before, a 6.8 percent decrease. Only three states  Colorado, Montana and Oklahoma  lost players at a higher rate over the same period. Most attributed the decline to increased concerns about player safety.
Carty, a past president of the executive board of the New Jersey coaches association, said that while the purpose of the new rules was to increase safety, they also could help slow the decline in participation. He said he and a number of other coaches in New Jersey had been following the guidelines announced Wednesday for the past few seasons. Now, they will apply to everyone.
Were not doing this as a recruiting ploy, he said. Its just we want to keep our kids safe and we want people to know this is happening. By making it a mandate statewide, it can ease the fears of a lot of parents that they wont have to investigate that their coach is doing it the right way.
Other states moved to put new limits on out-of-game contact before New Jersey did. At least seven allow only 60 minutes of full-contact practice each week, and Texas has also worked to reduce head injuries by offering junior high school and high school coachesseminars on rugby tackling, where the focus is on leading with the shoulder instead of the head.
The N.C.A.A. does not mandate limits for its college football teams, offering only recommendations. The various conferences set their own limits, ranging from the Pacific-12, which allows 90 minutes a week, to the Ivy League, which does not allow any full-contact training.
The N.F.L. allows 14 padded practices during its 18-week regular season, and one practice per day for each day of preseason.
Terry ONeil, the founder of Practice Like Pros, said that his organization, which includes former N.F.L. players and coaches, neurosurgeons and orthopedists, is not concerned with participation levels. The goal is to promote the safety of those playing the game now. The approval of the New Jersey rules, he said, is going to be very helpful for us in opening the conversation with other states around the country.Supported by

(Reuters) - The Rugby Football Union (RFU) on Tuesday banned Sale Sharks prop Jake Pope for six months following a second violation of their Illicit Drugs Programme.
The RFU said Pope was the first player to have breached the policy for a second time after a drug test in November returned an adverse analytical finding for cannabis and cocaine.
He admitted the violation at an independent disciplinary panel hearing in February, and the ban has been backdated to the day of his provisional suspension on Dec. 4, paving the way for a return in June.
Pope previously admitted a first violation following a test in 2017 and was fined 1,000 pounds although the RFU did not make their finding public as it was a first-time offence.
"The purpose of the Illicit Drugs Policy is primarily to protect the health and welfare of players," RFU's Anti-Doping and Illicit Drugs Programme manager Stephen Watkins said in a statement on the governing body's website.
"This is the first time we have had a second offence since the policy was established in 2010. It should send a strong deterrent message to all players that the RFU takes the misuse of substances seriously."
Sale described Pope's behaviour as "unacceptable" but offered their support.
"The club does not condone the misuse of drugs from any player and accept the decision made by the RFU," the Premiership club said in a statement on their website.

SYDNEY  Australia's players' union has joined Melbourne Victory boss Kevin Muscat in denouncing the "dangerous" Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) pitch after a player suffered a knee injury during an A-League match against Sydney FC on Saturday night.
Midfielder Terry Antonis fell to the ground untouched on the edge of the cricket square during a 2-1 loss for his side in a clash between the last two Australian champions.
The iconic ground is being used for football codes while the neighbouring Sydney Football Stadium is re-vamped and has already attracted criticism after it was torn up during a rugby match.
"It was dangerous, first and foremost," Muscat told reporters.
"To ask players to come and work under those conditions is unacceptable. It might be a serious injury as a result from it. And for players to go out onto that, whatever it's called, is a disgrace."
Professional Footballers Australia (PFA) called for an independent investigation into how the match was allowed to go ahead given the "deplorable state" of the pitch, which the body said posed a "clear danger" to "player safety".
"The players confirmed with us last night that they were not consulted at any stage on whether or not the match should proceed, notwithstanding the clear issues that the pitch presented to their livelihoods," chief executive John Didulica said in a statement.
"The PFA will ... recommend two clear resolutions for adoption. Firstly, that FFA immediately commission an independent investigation into the process undertaken to approve last night's match as being fit for play.
"Secondly, endorse a motion that players will no longer play on surfaces unacceptably compromised by a cricket wicket."
Sydney FC, whose victory kept them second in the A-League, are scheduled to host league leaders Perth Glory at the ground on April 18.
"The pitch clearly wasn't up to the standards required for professional football and we are working with the SCG Trust and FFA to assess its suitability to host our game against Perth in 11 days' time," said Sydney FC chief executive Danny Townsend.
"All options are on the table, including moving the game, and those discussions are already underway."
Some 3,000 square metres of turf at the ground were replaced last month after huge divots came up during a rugby union match between the New South Wales Waratahs and Queensland Reds.
The Sydney Roosters rugby league team have also used the ground and the various codes have varied the layout of the pitch in order to mitigate the impact of the three different types of grass on the surface.
The SCG has hosted test cricket since 1882 and was the venue for hundreds of rugby league and union matches before the SFS was completed in 1988. It has also been the home of the Sydney Swans Australian Rules team since 1982.
Didulica said the presence of a cricket wicket on a playing surface presented "an unreasonable danger to the health and safety of footballers".
"It remains the view of the PFA that players are under no obligation to participate in matches when such risks are present. This includes the SCG."

If you were trapped in a room and you had to break down the door to get out, you wouldnt hit that door with your head, says Rex Norris, who runs football for Atavus, a Seattle-based tackling consultancy that has worked with youth, high school, college and professional teams on shoulder-led tackling. After more than a decade of crisis and controversy over concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., American football organizations are looking to other sports like rugby and wrestling for alternative, lower-risk sacking methods. Never go into a tackle intending to hit with your head. Keep your head and neck out of the equation, Norris says. Last year, even the National Football League began penalizing players for helmet-led contact.
Get close before you strike. Decide which shoulder you intend to hit the person with, and then keep the foot on that side planted on the ground  if youre slamming with your left shoulder, for example, put your weight into the ball of your left foot as you make contact. Your power comes from your legs and feet, Norris says. Aim low: Ideally, your shoulder should hit your opponents thigh area, but consider anywhere between the pectoral muscles and the knees fair game. Square your body toward your opponent and, as you move forward, keep your elbows tucked in and your hands up, like a boxers. Maintain momentum after contact.
Finding newfangled ways to knock other humans down to the ground is something of a growth industry. The technique is not skill-specific, and its not age-specific, Norris says; in 2018, Atavus began providing mandatory shoulder-led tackling certification to all 23,000 high school and junior high school football coaches in Texas. Leaving your head out of a tackle isnt just a mind game, though; you need to do drills until muscle memory takes over. Players usually take to it quickly, but coaches tend to be more calcified in their ways. A quote Norris heard somewhere often comes to mind: Some coaches love winning so much theyre willing to change, and some coaches hate change so bad theyre willing to lose.

TOULOUSE, France  Former France coach Guy Noves is entitled to one million euros (£862,415) in compensation for wrongful dismissal by the national rugby federation, a French court said on Monday.
The FFR alleged Noves was guilty of serious misconduct, but a Toulouse labour tribunal decided otherwise. Noves was asking for 2.88 million euros.
Both parties have the right to appeal, although initial reactions suggested that they had accepted the outcome.
"I am satisfied with this decision. The FFR said there was serious misconduct and the tribunal said there was none," Noves, the first France rugby union coach to be sacked, told reporters.
"I don't know if we are going to appeal, we have a month to do so. The demands (from Noves) were excessive and the decision is reasonable," the FFR's lawyer Joseph Aguera told French sports newspaper L'Equipe.
The FFR later welcomed a "balanced" decision and said in a statement it did not plan to appeal.
Noves was sacked by the FFR in December 2017 after winning seven of his 21 matches in charge, while his contract was due to run until the end of this year's World Cup in Japan.
Noves, 65, was replaced by Jacques Brunel, who has been struggling to turn the situation around.
France beat Scotland and Italy in this year's Six Nations but lost against England, Ireland and Wales to finish fourth.

A day after reports that he will have shoulder surgery to fix a torn labrum, Dallas Cowboys defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence confirmed Monday he expects to miss the preseason while recovering in hopes of playing in Week 1.
Fresh off reaching a five-year deal to remain in Dallas, Lawrence said on The Rich Eisen Show that he will undergo surgery on Wednesday after putting off the procedure while he sorted out his contract, reportedly worth $105 million.
Lawrence, 26, played through the injury in the 2018 season and led the Cowboys with 10.5 sacks. The two-time Pro Bowler has 25 sacks over the past two seasons, with no other Cowboy recording double digits over the same span.
In five seasons in Dallas, Lawrence has a combined 34 sacks and 200 tackles in 64 games (47 starts). The Cowboys selected the Boise State product in the second round of the 2014 NFL Draft.
--The Kansas City Chiefs have reached agreement with linebacker Jeremiah Attaochu, according to the sports agency SportsTrust that represents the 26-year-old.
Attaochu played his first four NFL seasons (2014-17) with the Chargers -- three in San Diego, one in Los Angeles -- so he is mighty familiar with the AFC West. He had 10 sacks in 38 games (13 starts) with the Chargers. Attaochu was originally picked in the second round of the 2014 NFL Draft by the Chargers.
He signed with the San Francisco 49ers as a free agent in March 2018 but didn't make the team and was released. The New York Jets picked up Attaochu two days later and he had two sacks in 11 games.
--The Arizona Cardinals re-signed defensive tackle Rodney Gunter to a one-year contract, the team announced.
Gunter reportedly made a free-agent visit to the Green Bay Packers last week. The 27-year-old Gunter established career highs of 44 tackles and 4.5 sacks last year in his fourth season with the Cardinals. He has 95 tackles and eight sacks in 64 career games (25 starts).
The Cardinals also announced that they signed two offensive linemen who played for the recently disbanded Alliance of American Football: Andrew Lauderdale (Arizona Hotshots) and Jeremiah Poutasi (Salt Lake City Stallions).
--The Carolina Panthers announced the signing of five players, highlighted by former Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Destiny Vaeao and four others with experience in the now-suspended Alliance of American Football.
Vaeao, 25, has played parts of three seasons with the Eagles since signing as an undrafted free agent out of Washington State in 2016. He was cut by the Eagles last October and was signed to the New York Jets practice squad the following month, but never saw regular-season action.
In addition, the Panthers added four others who played in the AAF. The group includes Rashad Ross, 29, who caught 36 passes for 583 yards (16.2 yards per catch) and a league-best seven touchdowns for the Arizona Hotshots. His signing initially was reported on Thursday.
--The Miami Dolphins have reached a one-year deal with former Cleveland Browns wide receiver Ricardo Louis, according to multiple reports.
A fourth-round pick by the Browns in 2016, the 6-foot-2, 215-pound Louis missed all of last season with a neck injury that he had surgically repaired before training camp.
The two seasons prior, Louis appeared in all 32 games with 12 starts, catching 45 passes for 562 yards. He also averaged 18.2 yards on nine kickoff returns as a rookie after running a 4.43-second 40-yard dash at the Combine.
--Former rugby player Christian Wade has been allocated to the Buffalo Bills as part of the NFL's International Player Pathway Program, the team announced.
The 5-foot-8, 190-pound Wade was a highly decorated rugby star in the United Kingdom, having played for the national team at the U16, U18 and U20 levels, as well as making the British and Irish Lions squad. He retired from the rugby union last year to pursue playing in the NFL.
Wade's 82 tries (touchdowns) in Premiership Rugby, mostly as a ballcarrier, is third all-time and he has been designated as a running back with the Bills.
Wade, 27, is one of seven international athletes from five countries who have been training in Florida with the goal of landing one of four placements among AFC East teams this offseason. He participated in a pro day last week, where he was timed at 4.53 seconds in the 40-yard dash.
The four clubs will be allowed to carry an extra player (91 total) during training camp and, should the player not make the final roster, will also receive an extra practice squad spot for the allotted player. However, those placed on the practice squad with the international player exemption will be ineligible to be activated during the season.

Streaming Movie Review
ByBen Kenigsberg
The New Zealand comedy The Breaker Upperers adds some welcome irreverence to the homogenized mix of Netflix comedies. This collaboration between Jackie van Beek and Madeleine Sami  who wrote, directed and star together  exhibits their fairly irresistible comic chemistry, even if the conceit of the movie wears a bit thin.
Their characters, Jen (Van Beek) and Mel (Sami), operate an agency that helps clients too wimpy or sneaky to end their own relationships. Each case requires its own form of deception. The two are introduced posing as police officers who tell a woman (Celia Pacquola) that her husband  who is about to flee to Rio  has disappeared.
This is not an airtight line of work; for starters, as the movie acknowledges, it relies on Jen and Mels never running into anyone they deceive. But the business does supply Sami and Van Beek with a steady stream of gags until it becomes clear that the films real subject is their friendship. Mel has too much empathy to be a good liar, while Jen has grown wistful over the rocky end of one of her own past relationships. A cloud of mawkishness looms, though it never quite overshadows the rest.
Also funny is James Rolleston, who dryly steals scenes as a 17-year-old rugby player who seeks out Jen and Mels services. Not only is he probably too young to be experiencing such a baggage-laden breakup, but he is also, amusingly, not the sharpest tool in the shed.
That said, its possible the jokes about his bossy Maori girlfriend (Ana Scotney) play well in New Zealand. Here, they lean too heavily on stereotyping to land.

If you were trapped in a room and you had to break down the door to get out, you wouldnt hit that door with your head, says Rex Norris, who runs football for Atavus, a Seattle-based tackling consultancy that has worked with youth, high school, college and professional teams on shoulder-led tackling. After more than a decade of crisis and controversy over concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., American football organizations are looking to other sports like rugby and wrestling for alternative, lower-risk sacking methods. Never go into a tackle intending to hit with your head. Keep your head and neck out of the equation, Norris says. Last year, even the National Football League began penalizing players for helmet-led contact.
Get close before you strike. Decide which shoulder you intend to hit the person with, and then keep the foot on that side planted on the ground  if youre slamming with your left shoulder, for example, put your weight into the ball of your left foot as you make contact. Your power comes from your legs and feet, Norris says. Aim low: Ideally, your shoulder should hit your opponents thigh area, but consider anywhere between the pectoral muscles and the knees fair game. Square your body toward your opponent and, as you move forward, keep your elbows tucked in and your hands up, like a boxers. Maintain momentum after contact.
Finding newfangled ways to knock other humans down to the ground is something of a growth industry. The technique is not skill-specific, and its not age-specific, Norris says; in 2018, Atavus began providing mandatory shoulder-led tackling certification to all 23,000 high school and junior high school football coaches in Texas. Leaving your head out of a tackle isnt just a mind game, though; you need to do drills until muscle memory takes over. Players usually take to it quickly, but coaches tend to be more calcified in their ways. A quote Norris heard somewhere often comes to mind: Some coaches love winning so much theyre willing to change, and some coaches hate change so bad theyre willing to lose.

LONDON  Reza Rashidian could give Dos Equis famous and fictional most interesting man in the world a run for his money.
Mr. Rashidian has been a racecar driver, big game hunter, movie producer, real estate magnate, bon vivant, aspiring poet and artist, and noted collector  of cars, 19th-century animal sculptures, and watches.
It took him more than 20 years of dedicated hunting to amass what he called the ultimate dive watch collection, featuring what several industry experts have called one of the rarest watches in existence: Rolexs Deepsea Special Number One. (The collection recently was detailed in the book A Journey Into the Deep by John Goldberger and Daniel Bourn.)
As Mr. Rashidian is considered a friend of Phillips auction house, and its London office on Berkeley Square was a convenient place to take a look at some of his scores of watches, we met on a recent springlike afternoon. And Mr. Rashidian explained why, after years of collecting all manner of watches, he decided to focus on Rolex stainless steel dive watches. These watches went to the greatest depths on earth, he said, with divers risking their lives and equipment. The watches are firmly a part of the human condition.
The collector witnessed another side of the human condition firsthand as a young boy growing up in Tehran. In 1978 his father, who was in banking and real estate, sensed unrest and moved the family to a home they had in London, just for the summer, Mr. Rashidian said. But the Shah of Iran was deposed in January 1979 and the family  its banks confiscated and some of its friends killed  never left England. Mr. Rashidian, now 52, lived in London most of his life before moving to Switzerland three years ago, trading the city for the mountains.
Nature was an important part of the collectors early years, too. When he was 5 he started hunting with his uncle. It wasnt about killing, he said, but being outdoors and experiencing nature in the rain, the snow, in all its guises. His shoots might have taken him to Ethiopia or Tajikistan for weeks at a time, sleeping in tents or shacks. You have to love the outdoors, he said.
Hunting led him to create the cultishly popularPro Hunter watchin 2006 after Rolex refused to customize one of its watches with a black case and glass (to eliminate reflection), fixed lugs and a NATO strap (to replace a bracelet that, Mr. Rashidian said, you cant crawl with, it digs in.) So he developed his own timepiece.
Soon others wanted one, and owners now include President Bill Clinton; Antoine Arnault of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton; François-Henri Pinault of Kering; Prince Pavlos of Greece; and Mr. Rashidians friends Tim Jeffries, owner of Hamiltons gallery in London, and the actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers.
Mr. Rashidian now is no longer involved in the business. And he no longer hunts. Not for big game, anyway, but he said he used some of the same strategies when collecting. A hunt starts with research, which interests me more than the ownership, he said, a testament to his years studying history at London and Oxford universities. Another of the joys: When you collect you find people with similar enthusiasm, and you share it, at dinners and events where he meets other watch fans.
His love of watches began early: His father, who died when Mr. Rashidian was 13, gave him his first watch. Mr. Rashidian opened a case and displayed a Rolex Oyster Perpetual Datejust, with a strap now too small to circle his wrist. This put the thought in my head. This is where it started, he said.
Next, his mother gave him a gold Rolex Day-Date Oysterquartz for his 18th birthday, and soon after Mr. Rashidian made his own first purchase, a Rolex stainless steel GMT Master. (He raised the sleeve of his Hackett suit jacket to show that he still wears it.)
In his 20s, when he started collecting watches, he bought some contemporary models like Patek Philippes, Audemars Piguets and Breguets. And Rolexes, which he said he preferred to wear because they stood up to constant use and were more approachable, and stainless steel is much more approachable. He still has some of these early purchases in his collection.
The more he learned about watches  especially about their histories, he said  the more he gravitated toward vintage ones. And few watches can rival the story of the Rolex Deep Sea Special Number One: In 1953, the watch, which has a signature bubble-shaped crystal, was strapped to the outside of the Trieste bathyscaph before the research vessel went two miles deep in the waters off Italys Ponza Island, withstanding pressure of 8,820 pounds per square inch.
The bathyscaph and the watch later went down even farther, to nearly 2.3 miles deep. As a result, Rolex marketing began making the brands claim to dive watch supremacy and, by extension, sports watch dominance.
Mr. Rashidian had brought the Deepsea Special Number One with him, and carefully removed the timepiece from its special case to display its unusual 35-millimeter thickness and distinctive domed crystal. He placed it on the table with the other watches he had brought. There, he said in a ta-da moment, is the most famous Rolex dive watch in the world sitting next to the dinky one I got as a boy.
Mr. Rashidian recently sold two of his 36 dive watches featured in the book at a Phillips auction in Geneva: a Rolex Single Red Sea-Dweller, which once belonged to the celebrated diver Robert Palmer Bradley, and a Rolex Sea-Dweller made for the Sultan of Oman, with his name, Qaboos, in Arabic on the dial.
He put those two up for sale because, after having amassed and documented what he considers the ultimate dive watch collection, he now is contemplating starting on something new and is deep into research.
He wont say what his next focus will be, (dont reveal your hand is one of his strategies) but it will be something special, as he said collectors should buy something unique or rare that has intrinsic or personal value.
I need to find new areas that excite me, he said, and admitted that patience is not his strong suit, and apparently never has been.
When he was a student at the British public school Haileybury, he was captain of the rugby team and looked down his nose at cricket. I didnt have the patience to play that game. It seems like nothing happens for a very long time, and then suddenly people start to clap. Its not in my personality. Im less cricket, more rugby. And ready to score his next great collection.

CHICAGO  Just before the dangerously cold temperatures set in across the Midwest this week, Michael Belz was occupied with thoughts of his son Gerald, an 18-year-old in his first year at the University of Iowa.
Classes at the university had been canceled. Campus was only a half-hour away from the Belz home in Cedar Rapids. But Gerald had opted to stay put and wait out the cold snap in his dorm.
At the time, I thought that was the smart move, Michael Belz said, remembering that his son had trouble getting his truck started the weekend before. I didnt want him to get stuck somewhere driving. So he decided he would stay.
Early Wednesday morning, as the temperatures were plummeting, Gerald Belz was found unconscious outside a campus building, a short walk from his dorm. He died later at a hospital. Investigators believe his death was related to the subzero temperatures that plunged Iowa and all of the Midwest into a miserable and dangerous cold snap this week.
He is one of at least 21 people whose deaths, government officials say, are believed to be related to the bitter weather system that has paralyzed the region. The frigid conditions have sent scores of people to hospitals with symptoms of hypothermia or frostbite, and have closed businesses, schools and many colleges.
Many of the deaths, which occurred since Sunday, were still being investigated, and precise causes had not yet been established. But officials said in each case that they believed the weather had played a role.
Among those who have perished, according to local coroners, police and fire departments and other officials: Four men found frozen near their homes in Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan; six people who died in traffic crashes in Iowa; a pedestrian hit with a snowplow in Libertyville, Ill.; a man found dead between two FedEx trucks at a distribution center in East Moline, Ill.; and a woman found frozen to death inside a Milwaukee apartment after the thermostat malfunctioned.
In the Buffalo area, one person died Thursday while using a snowblower, and another was found dead after shoveling. Earlier in the week, a married couple in their 20s died in Indiana in a car crash, a man in Milwaukee was found dead in his garage after shoveling and a man died of hypothermia in Evanston, Ill.
In Williamsville, N.Y., outside Buffalo, a homeless man was pronounced dead after being discovered inside a bus shelter on Thursday morning. Helen Tederous, a spokeswoman for the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, which is investigating the death, said that the man, Lawrence Bierl, 69, had been a fixture in suburban Buffalo for years.
He was a real gentle soul, she said. He would talk to people a lot. People got to know him.
An official cause of death had not been determined, but Ms. Tederous and a county official said it appeared to be related to the cold.
Since the polar air mass set in, several cities have hit record low temperatures, and it appeared that Illinois may have broken the states all-time low: A weather observer in Mount Carroll, Ill., recorded a temperature of minus 38 degrees Fahrenheit on Thursday morning.
In Rockford, Ill., temperatures dipped to minus 31, colder than the previous record of minus 27 from 1982. Moline, Ill., also broke a record, reaching minus 33, according to the National Weather Service. So did Cedar Rapids, Iowa, with minus 30.
Officials across the Midwest told of harrowing rescues and perilous situations. The Illinois State Policeassistedmore than 1,300 drivers over one eight-hour period, and the Coast Guard used air boats to rescue seven people stranded in an ice shanty on Lake Michigan off Sturgeon Bay, Wis. A Coast Guard ship sliced through the ice on Lake Huron to rescue a woman needing medical attention on Mackinac Island, Mich. And in Wheeling, Ill., nine members of a family, including a 2-month-old infant, were hospitalized for carbon monoxide exposure after apparently trying to keep their house warm using a charcoal grill in addition to the furnace.
The weather forecast suggested that some relief was ahead for the Midwest, with temperatures expected to poke above zero by Thursday night. But forecasters warned of a continuing cold wave in the Northeast, with heavy snow in some places and subzero wind chills in others.
[Read more about the warmer weather on the way here.]
In Iowa, the Belz family said it was awaiting more information from the police about Geralds death, and University of Iowa officials said that counselors had been made available to help students.
On Monday, the university hadcanceled classesfor part of Tuesday, all of Wednesday, and Thursday morning because of the weather. Michael Belz said he had no idea what his son might have been doing that took him outside his dorm room in the early morning hours on Wednesday.
Officials at the local medical examiners office said they had performed an autopsy, but did not have final results and would not release information on the cause of death until they did. University of Iowa police said their investigation was continuing, but that Gerald Belzs death was believed to be related to the weather.
A pre-med student, he had been in contact with his girlfriend, Leeanne Mehring-Cruz, through text messages and Snapchat video in the hours before he died, but had dropped off social media around 1 a.m.
Ms. Mehring-Cruz, who lives in Cedar Rapids, said she had been seeing Gerald Belz for two years. She described him as sweet and brilliant, someone who only showed his soft side to his closest family and friends. One of the last things he wrote that last night, she said in an interview conducted over Twitter, was that he loved how she was always there for him through everything.
I wish I could have protected him then, she said.
Ms. Mehring-Cruz said she is hoping the police will quickly find out where he was going and what happened to him. I have no clue what he was doing, she said. The last messages we sent were I love yous and good nights.
Michael Belz said Gerald, the older of his two sons, was careful and compassionate, studious and avid rugby player who wanted to become a doctor. He was already ahead in his college studies because he had completed Advanced Placement classes in high school.
He played football in high school, but then turned to rugby. He loved it, much to the chagrin of his mother, who wanted to protect him and keep him safe, the father said. He had a great time with it.
The Belzes last saw their son on Sunday evening, when he was visiting home. Snow had started to fall, and Michael Belz urged him to head back to campus before things got too slippery.
So Gerald gathered up his things, said his goodbyes and drove back to his dorm. Around 10 p.m., he called his mother to give her the customary assurance: He had arrived safely.

When youre lucky enough to get a visit from Sam Sifton, The New York Timess food editor, you eat. And when you eat with Sam, you learn and you gorge.
This week, we did oodles of both at Momofuku Seiobo in Sydney, thanks to the chef Paul Carmichael.
He cooked for a small group of us. We were seated at the bar by the kitchen, giving us a chance to watch in awe as he and his team delivered a meal unlike any other. It started with a savory plantain doughnut, followed by sea urchin on crunchy cassava, duck, fish heads (they were amazing, really), a cold pork soup and a spiced cake Im hoping will appear in my dreams.
This was the strong personal imprint that Pete Wells, The Timess main restaurant critic,identified when he wrote about Paul in 2017.
Somehow, near a casino in Sydney, he wrote, there was a chef from the United States via Barbados, who treats Australia as a Caribbean island that somehow got loose and wandered thousands of miles into the Pacific.
In our case, Paul added a touch more detail and intrigue with each dish he sent our way. Near the end, when we got to his version of souse  a light pork stew from Barbados that he served cold and elegant  he was clearly in a groove.
[Hungry?ReadBesha Rodells reviewof Momofuku Seiobo.]
We asked him about how or where he works out his concoctions. He turned us a sly smile.
Youve got to be connected, he said.
What do you mean? we asked.
He pointed to what we were eating. It had only four ingredients, and because the pork came from oft-unused parts of the pig ( the feet, the face etc.) the flavors and texture changed with each batch. The timing of when to serve it changed too, he said, depending how the ingredients interacted.
If you just sent someone the recipe, and they just did that, it wouldnt work, he said. Youve got to be connected.
Aha  suddenly, I got it.
This was not the usual connected  it was the opposite of email, of social media, or of the connected sometimes used to refer to mafia figures or real-life power dynamics.
This was the connected of concentration  deep concentration and the maintenance of focus in service of creativity.
It was the same radioactive element described earlier in the night by Kylie Kwong, the owner and chef behind the restaurant Billy Kwong, who was interviewed by Sam at Carriageworks for Times subscribers.
She talked a lot with Sam about becoming obsessed  with native Australian ingredients for one  and about how shes happiest when living in the moment.
For both Kylie and Paul, staying connected to what you make seemed to be a prerequisite for fulfillment. I tend to agree: Whether its food, fiction, art or journalism, there needs to be time and room for holding on, trying, reflecting, trying and trying again.
In todays world, this is not an easy thing to pull off. Many of us need help.
When we looked at Februarys most popular Times stories for Australian readers and readers around the world, these two came up:
Do Not Disturb: How I Ditched My Phone and Unbroke My Brain
Let Children Get Bored Again: Boredom teaches us that life isnt a parade of amusements. More important, it spawns creativity and self-sufficiency.
What that tells me is that something deep in our collective soul  or at least the collective soul of Times readers  seems to know that we need more of what Pauls talking about.
We need to be connected  the question is: How?
Next time Sam comes to Australia, Ill do my best to keep probing. And eating. And learning.
Now here are a few stories to chew on, chosen by our bureaus hungry up-and-comer, Isabella Kwai.

BURNLEY, England  When Mike Phelan was asked if he would like to return to Manchester United and assist Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in turning the club around after the sacking of Jose Mourinho in December, he barely paused for thought before agreeing.
Having enjoyed plenty of success at Old Trafford as Alex Ferguson's trusted right-hand man, the chance to return after a six year absence was not an opportunity the 56-year-old was going to let pass.
But while that was an instant decision, there had been plenty of contemplation during his time away from the club.
"I had a time of reflection. I felt that I needed to look back and examine the processes that were in place. Because you just don't get the time when you are actually 'in it'," he told Reuters at his East Lancashire home.
Phelan wanted to look back to find out exactly how United had enjoyed such dominance and conversations with Ferguson and former United CEO David Gill formed part of that process.
But after a brief spell as manager of Hull City in the 2016-17 season, with the club poorly resourced and heading for relegation, Phelan took time away from the game and decided to extend that investigation of leadership skills.
"I thought I needed to find out more. I am quite an open-minded sort of fella and the more people you meet, the more areas of expertise you venture into, you find yourself searching for that common denominator," he said.
Phelan talked to people in rugby and other sports and looked at American coaching and management methods as well as the world of business.
"What I found was that the simplicity in most things tends to be the most effective. We are all looking for the secret ingredient but when you start to talk to people at the elite level, the top end, you find they do the simple things better than most people," added the former United player.
COLLABORATION
As Phelan describes the conclusions he reached, it is also evident they have been put into practise at United since December.
"The (leaders) communicate better and they actually hand over the reigns to people to get on with their jobs. You bring people into your environment, you communicate well, you express your thought process and then you hand it over and see what comes back," he said.
A look at the technical area during games reveals that approach in action. Solskjaer is in charge but Phelan frequently is out on the touch-line guiding players and the other coaches, Michael Carrick and Kieran McKenna, are also part of the collaboration.
"I like the idea of sharing, seeing people grow, (then) the end product," he says.
Still, Phelan has been surprised how quickly Solskjaer was able to change the mood at the club, bringing back a sense of enjoyment.
"It was an instant response," he says, noting the way that Solskjaer created a "breath of fresh air" around the club's Carrington training complex.
SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT
The challenge, now that the Norwegian has been appointed the long-term manager, is to turn that 'bounce' into a more substantial improvement. Phelan believes they are helped by having players who still have plenty of scope for improvement, none more so than Paul Pogba.
Pogba looked unhappy and unsettled during the latter period of Mourinho's time at the club but has shone since the change.
"I think that happened to quite a few players, they probably drew into themselves a little bit and were very cautious," says Phelan.
"Paul had a spell where all the eyes were on him and delivery of his best wasn't there all the time, the consistency.
"Now we are trying to apply ourselves to Paul's game. Ole has done a terrific job at helping Paul through certain spells and he has embraced that. He is maturing all the time.
"He is not the finished deal even though everyone looks at him and sees a World Cup winner already but he is not the finished deal, there is still a lot more to come and that is the exciting bit about United.
"There are players there who haven't achieved for the club what they need to achieve and we want to make sure that they relish that experience, embrace the opportunity to win things at Manchester United."
Another of those players is left back Luke Shaw, who has significantly improved in recent months.
"We think that there is more to come from Luke  he is young, he is energetic and he has an attitude which is developing all the time. We feel that the world is his oyster... he is a huge player," says Phelan.
GLORY DAYS
With United facing Barcelona in a Champions League quarter-final first leg on Wednesday, there is the sense of the club being on the right path to rediscovering their glory days.
Phelan certainly doesn't feel the past is a weight on the club nor has that success reduced his own personal hunger.
"I want these players to enjoy their own great moments for themselves but I also want to do it again  that is the drive," he said.
"It is different this time around, of course it is. It was six years ago, but it is not impossible, definitely not impossible."

If you were trapped in a room and you had to break down the door to get out, you wouldnt hit that door with your head, says Rex Norris, who runs football for Atavus, a Seattle-based tackling consultancy that has worked with youth, high school, college and professional teams on shoulder-led tackling. After more than a decade of crisis and controversy over concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., American football organizations are looking to other sports like rugby and wrestling for alternative, lower-risk sacking methods. Never go into a tackle intending to hit with your head. Keep your head and neck out of the equation, Norris says. Last year, even the National Football League began penalizing players for helmet-led contact.
Get close before you strike. Decide which shoulder you intend to hit the person with, and then keep the foot on that side planted on the ground  if youre slamming with your left shoulder, for example, put your weight into the ball of your left foot as you make contact. Your power comes from your legs and feet, Norris says. Aim low: Ideally, your shoulder should hit your opponents thigh area, but consider anywhere between the pectoral muscles and the knees fair game. Square your body toward your opponent and, as you move forward, keep your elbows tucked in and your hands up, like a boxers. Maintain momentum after contact.
Finding newfangled ways to knock other humans down to the ground is something of a growth industry. The technique is not skill-specific, and its not age-specific, Norris says; in 2018, Atavus began providing mandatory shoulder-led tackling certification to all 23,000 high school and junior high school football coaches in Texas. Leaving your head out of a tackle isnt just a mind game, though; you need to do drills until muscle memory takes over. Players usually take to it quickly, but coaches tend to be more calcified in their ways. A quote Norris heard somewhere often comes to mind: Some coaches love winning so much theyre willing to change, and some coaches hate change so bad theyre willing to lose.

WELLINGTON  Ardie Savea scored two sensational long-range tries to showcase his blistering speed and help the Hurricanes down the Highlanders in Dunedin on Friday.
Captain TJ Perenara and Ngani Laumape also scored tries for the Hurricanes, who were guilty of making too many errors and struggled for much of the game in the set piece but managed to score when they needed to sneak to victory.
Shannon Frizell, Ash Dixon, Kayne Hammington, James Lentjes all crossed for the home side, who had numerous attacking lineouts after the fulltime hooter but could not score.
The Highlanders had lost three of their last four games, while their March 16 match against the Canterbury Crusaders was cancelled due to the mass shooting in Christchurch the previous day.
One of those losses was due to a last minute penalty by Beauden Barrett in Wellington, where their forwards dominated and their defence put pressure on the flyhalf, shutting off his time and space.
The Highlanders again used their forwards and tactical kickers to play inside the Hurricanes' territory, force errors and build phases in an otherwise frenetic first half where the visitors were guilty of poor execution in their set piece.
That pressure led to first half tries to Frizell and replacement hooker Dixon, whose try was controversial with television replays indicating he had lost control of the ball.
The Hurricanes, who had fallen behind to Frizell's 19th-minute try, were able to strike back almost immediately when Perenara exploited a gap close to the line after one of their few sustained buildups.
Dixon's 28th-minute try, however, gave the home side a 14-7 lead, which they looked set to extend on the stroke of halftime only for Savea to intercept a loose pass and sprint away to lock the score at 14-14 at the break.
Barrett kicked the first penalty of the game early in the second half, only for the Highlanders forwards to go up another level and dominate the next 15 minutes with Hammington and Lentjes both crossing to give the home side a 28-17 lead.
Lentjes' try appeared to be the one to seal the game only for Savea to finish off a strong midfield break from Ben Lam and then Laumape jinked his way past three defenders after Barrett had set him up.
The Highlanders had numerous chances to win the game after the fulltime hooter with a succession of attacking lineouts but knocked the ball on to end the match.

SYDNEY  Lloyd McDermott, one of the first indigenous Australians to play for the Wallabies and the nation's first Aboriginal barrister, has died aged 79, Rugby Australia said on Sunday.
A pacy winger, McDermott won two caps against New Zealand in 1962 but refused to tour apartheid South Africa the following year as an "honorary white" and switched codes to rugby league.
Along with his career in the law, McDermott worked throughout his life to encourage indigenous youth to play rugby union, in later years through his eponymous development team the "Lloydies".
"His legacy is not just his work in promoting sport to young people it is also about equality in opportunities for young people," said Gary Ella, who now runs the team.
"The ... team's objectives are based on Lloyds leadership of creating education and opportunities for young people and supporting them to make positive lifestyle decisions.
"Lloyd's work has positively influenced thousands of young Indigenous people around Australia."A proud but humble man, he refused to accept Australia Day honours on several occasions until the rights of Aboriginal people were recognised. We will miss a close friend and we are inspired to continue our work."
The three Ella brothers, Gary, Mark and Glenn, all played for Australia and make up a fifth of the indigenous Wallabies in over 120 years of test rugby for the nation.
Cecil Ramalli, the son of an Indian father and Aboriginal mother who played two tests in 1938, is widely acknowledged as the first Wallaby of indigenous heritage.

If you were trapped in a room and you had to break down the door to get out, you wouldnt hit that door with your head, says Rex Norris, who runs football for Atavus, a Seattle-based tackling consultancy that has worked with youth, high school, college and professional teams on shoulder-led tackling. After more than a decade of crisis and controversy over concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., American football organizations are looking to other sports like rugby and wrestling for alternative, lower-risk sacking methods. Never go into a tackle intending to hit with your head. Keep your head and neck out of the equation, Norris says. Last year, even the National Football League began penalizing players for helmet-led contact.
Get close before you strike. Decide which shoulder you intend to hit the person with, and then keep the foot on that side planted on the ground  if youre slamming with your left shoulder, for example, put your weight into the ball of your left foot as you make contact. Your power comes from your legs and feet, Norris says. Aim low: Ideally, your shoulder should hit your opponents thigh area, but consider anywhere between the pectoral muscles and the knees fair game. Square your body toward your opponent and, as you move forward, keep your elbows tucked in and your hands up, like a boxers. Maintain momentum after contact.
Finding newfangled ways to knock other humans down to the ground is something of a growth industry. The technique is not skill-specific, and its not age-specific, Norris says; in 2018, Atavus began providing mandatory shoulder-led tackling certification to all 23,000 high school and junior high school football coaches in Texas. Leaving your head out of a tackle isnt just a mind game, though; you need to do drills until muscle memory takes over. Players usually take to it quickly, but coaches tend to be more calcified in their ways. A quote Norris heard somewhere often comes to mind: Some coaches love winning so much theyre willing to change, and some coaches hate change so bad theyre willing to lose.

TOULOUSE, France  Former France coach Guy Noves is entitled to one million euros (£862,415) in compensation for wrongful dismissal by the national rugby federation, a French court said on Monday.
The FFR alleged Noves was guilty of serious misconduct, but a Toulouse labour tribunal decided otherwise. Noves was asking for 2.88 million euros.
Both parties have the right to appeal, although initial reactions suggested that they had accepted the outcome.
"I am satisfied with this decision. The FFR said there was serious misconduct and the tribunal said there was none," Noves, the first France rugby union coach to be sacked, told reporters.
"I don't know if we are going to appeal, we have a month to do so. The demands (from Noves) were excessive and the decision is reasonable," the FFR's lawyer Joseph Aguera told French sports newspaper L'Equipe.
The FFR later welcomed a "balanced" decision and said in a statement it did not plan to appeal.
Noves was sacked by the FFR in December 2017 after winning seven of his 21 matches in charge, while his contract was due to run until the end of this year's World Cup in Japan.
Noves, 65, was replaced by Jacques Brunel, who has been struggling to turn the situation around.
France beat Scotland and Italy in this year's Six Nations but lost against England, Ireland and Wales to finish fourth.

Facing a significant decline in the number of students playing high school football, the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association on Wednesday adopted new guidelines to sharply reduce the amount of contact allowed in practices and, in doing so, address concerns about player safety.
The new rules, which the association said were the most restrictive in the country, limits the time that teams can engage in full-contact drills in practice to 15 minutes a week, down from the 90 allowed under the old rules. Preseason full-contact drills, previously unlimited, will be reduced to six total hours, including scrimmages.
The existing ban on full contact in spring and summer practices in New Jersey remains in effect. New Jersey officials said that other states are considering similar restrictions as concerns about head injuries continue to grow.
I think this is a positive thing based on what we know now about player safety and the more education that we are all getting all the time about how to keep players healthy, said Kevin Carty Jr., the coach at Hillsborough High School in central New Jersey.
The New Jersey association said it implemented the rules on the recommendation of the New Jersey Football Coaches Association and Practice Like Pros, an organization that advocates the exact limits on practices that have now been adopted by New Jersey.
Full contact is considered tackling that brings a player to the ground.
Jesse Mez, an associate professor of neurology at Boston University and member of the schools Alzheimers Center and CTE Center, applauded the new regulations. He said that there is good evidence to show a relationship between the dangers of repetitive impacts in football  and not just those involving concussions  and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the degenerative disease linked to repeated blows to the head. He said the exact nature of that relationship has not been fully measured.
I think there are better ways of playing team sports and getting exercise than repeatedly hitting your head, Mez said. But given the countrys interest in football and how much everybody loves it, if we are not going to stop playing, then we should reduce the amount of contact as much as we can.
Despite its risks, tackle football is still among the most popular sports for male youths from ages 14 to 17. But participation is falling, and particularlyin New Jersey, a state long known for being rich in high school football talent.
In 2017, 1,700 fewer players were reported playing high school football in New Jersey than the year before, a 6.8 percent decrease. Only three states  Colorado, Montana and Oklahoma  lost players at a higher rate over the same period. Most attributed the decline to increased concerns about player safety.
Carty, a past president of the executive board of the New Jersey coaches association, said that while the purpose of the new rules was to increase safety, they also could help slow the decline in participation. He said he and a number of other coaches in New Jersey had been following the guidelines announced Wednesday for the past few seasons. Now, they will apply to everyone.
Were not doing this as a recruiting ploy, he said. Its just we want to keep our kids safe and we want people to know this is happening. By making it a mandate statewide, it can ease the fears of a lot of parents that they wont have to investigate that their coach is doing it the right way.
Other states moved to put new limits on out-of-game contact before New Jersey did. At least seven allow only 60 minutes of full-contact practice each week, and Texas has also worked to reduce head injuries by offering junior high school and high school coachesseminars on rugby tackling, where the focus is on leading with the shoulder instead of the head.
The N.C.A.A. does not mandate limits for its college football teams, offering only recommendations. The various conferences set their own limits, ranging from the Pacific-12, which allows 90 minutes a week, to the Ivy League, which does not allow any full-contact training.
The N.F.L. allows 14 padded practices during its 18-week regular season, and one practice per day for each day of preseason.
Terry ONeil, the founder of Practice Like Pros, said that his organization, which includes former N.F.L. players and coaches, neurosurgeons and orthopedists, is not concerned with participation levels. The goal is to promote the safety of those playing the game now. The approval of the New Jersey rules, he said, is going to be very helpful for us in opening the conversation with other states around the country.Supported by

Less than a month after theNew England Patriots won the Super Bowl, a group of Massachusetts lawmakers has proposed a bill that would ban organized youth tackle football until after seventh grade.
The bill, which moved to the Massachusetts legislaturesJoint Committee on Public Healththis week, follows unsuccessful attempts by legislators in five other states to pass similar measures to protect growing brains from traumatic injury.
The bipartisan bill, known asNo Hits, would impose financial penalties for any school league or other entity that does not comply.
There is significant science detailing repetitive head impacts have long-term neurological consequences, especially when they occur during brain development, one of the bills sponsors, Representative Paul A. Schmid III, a Democrat, said in a statement.
Although some medical professionals and former N.F.L. players have signaled their support for the measure andpublic opinion could buoy its prospects, the bill is already facing headwinds.
Two representatives who initially supported the measure have withdrawn their names from the bill, and a few other legislators said they would not support it.
Should we ban youth soccer too? asked Representative David Nangle, a Democrat who opposes the bill. Or youth hockey? When do we stop legislating into areas that we shouldnt be?
A spokeswoman for U.S.A. Football, whichgoverns youth football, said in a statement that the organization believes that decisions on allowing children to play football are best left to parents. To that end, she said, it has createda set of guidelinesdeveloped by leaders in athlete development and football.
The executive director of Pop Warner, Jon Butler, said in a statement that the organization had worked to improve player safety by eliminating the three-point stance and removing kickoffs for younger athletes. Banning football is not the answer, but we do agree that we should continue our efforts to make the game safer for our kids, he said.
Studiesby Boston Universityand other research centers have shown that children who began playing tackle football before the age of 12 were at greater risk for cognitive, mood and behavioral issues later in life, as well as conditions like chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.
But there has been opposition to those findings from the N.F.L. and even from well-intentioned parents, said Michael Kaplen, a lawyer whoteaches a legal course on traumatic brain injuryandtracks legislation governing youth tackle football. Mr. Kaplen said that there was no such thing as safer tackling and that a youth leagues promoting safer tackling would be similar to big tobacco companies offering low-nicotine cigarettes.
People dont understand that even a minor blow to the head has risks, he said. It may take years for these problems to become unmasked.
Steve Dembowski, 49, an executive board member of theMassachusetts High School Football Coaches Association, said parents, rather than the state, should be able to make choices for their children.
Considering that kids at that age get concussions playing soccer and baseball and any other sport where they can fall and hit their head on the ground, he said, it seems like an overstep of authority.
Damon Stanton, 43, has two sons who play football, and he coachesyouth football in Hanson, Mass., about 25 miles south of Boston.
I understand the concern, he said, citing the Boston University study. But he said more attention should be paid to the work that is being done to make the sport safer since the knuckle-dragging days when you would hit hit hit, and run until you were puking during practice.
He said his team had invested in new equipment, like foam tires that minimize player contact during practices, and introducedshoulder-tackling techniques developed byU.S.A. Football.
Mr. Stanton acknowledged that he might not be as influential as the Patriots head coach, Bill Belichick, adding that he is not a political guy.
But, he said, Ill definitely be calling my rep to let him know how I feel.
In recent years, tackle football has lost some of its luster among middle and high schoolers, and their parents. In 2017, about 2.4 million athletes from ages 6 to 17 regularly played the sport, down slightly from the year before, according tothe Sports & Fitness Industry Association. Rugby is gaining popularity because its tackling techniques appear less risky, whichincreasingly appeals to coaches who are leery of concussions.
There have been moves in some parts of the country to further address player safety for tackle football at the high school level. This month, the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Associationadopted new guidelinesintended to sharply reduce the amount of contact allowed during high school practices.
But several efforts last year to pass statewide legislation governing youth leagues werequashed by grass-roots movementsled by parents and coaches.
When Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle of New Jerseyproposed banning tackle football for children under 12, parents, coaches and players threatened to vote her out of office, she said in an email.
That bill is currently in limbo.
Unfortunately, the old boys club of politics and football go hand in hand, said Ms. Huttle, a Democrat. This bill has and will continue to receive pushback because it goes against the American grain.
A similar billin New York failed, and Californias Safe Football Act waspulled before a committee vote.The Dave Duerson Act, named after a Chicago Bears player who killed himself at age 50,did not make it past the Illinois legislature. And Marylands proposal, which also would have prohibited heading in soccer,was killed in committee.
These efforts, futile as they sometimes prove to be, still have a positive effect, supporters say.
I really did not expect it to pass, said Delegate Terri Hill, the Democratic legislator who sponsored Marylands bill.
But I think its a conversation we have to have, she said, and I dont think the conversation is over.
Representative Bradley H. Jones, a Republican who is a sponsor of the Massachusetts bill, echoed Ms. Hill.
Some football programs have already made changes indicating that there is at least some recognition of this problem, he said. If this bill does nothing else, I am hopeful that it starts a dialogue that will lead to the implementation of best practices and standards across the board to protect kids from long-term brain injuries.

Cash bribes were called monopoly money, and handed out to high-ranking members of South Africas governing party on monthly retainers. When that payoff wasnt enough, $22,000 was stuffed into a Louis Vuitton handbag and delivered to a close ally of the president at the time.
That sent the recipient over the moon, according to Angelo Agrizzi, a businessman  and now whistle-blower  who detailed, at a continuinggovernment inquiryinto public corruption, extravagant bribes doled out to members of the party, the African National Congress, at the highest levels of government.
A current government minister, he testified, liked receiving an annual Christmas basket that included four cases of high-quality whiskey, 40 cases of beer, eight lambs  cut up, obviously. Her daughter was partial to high-end convertibles, Audi A3 Cabriolets, but kept crashing the cars given to her.
So I actually called her in one day and sat her down and said, Can I arrange for driver training, special driver training for you, because it was getting embarrassing, Mr. Agrizzi said.
The granular details about the bribes in South Africa, where widespread corruption hasgutted state institutions and public programs, emerged after several days of explosive testimony, broadcast live nationwide, by Mr. Agrizzi at the inquiry. Mr. Agrizzi was the chief operating officer ofBosasa, a South African logistics company that he said handed out between $300,000 to $440,000 a month in cash bribes to senior A.N.C. officials to secure lucrative government contracts.
Mr. Agrizzi, who wrapped up his testimony on Tuesday, implicated by name not only powerful politicians, but also senior civil servants who he said had facilitated transactions or were paid to look away. Though Bosasa had long been accused of unethical and illegal conduct, the company continued to win government contracts through its ties with the A.N.C.
Even President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has pledged to clean up South Africa, is being investigated for his ties to Bosasa.
Last week, the public protectors office, a government agency responsible for investigating corruption, started an investigation into $37,000 given by Bosasa to Mr. Ramaphosas campaign before party elections in December 2017  and also into whether Mr. Ramaphosa misled Parliament about why that money was given.
On Tuesday, Mr. Ramaphosa met with the public protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, to discuss the case, said Oupa Segalwe, a spokesman for the office.
Initially, Mr. Ramaphosa said in Parliament that the payment had been made to his son, Andile, for doing consulting work for Bosasa. Mr. Ramaphosa later said that the money was donated by the company to his 2017 campaign. He added that he had not been aware of the donation and pledged to return it.
The president performed a spectacular about-turn and was forced to admit to the nation that his campaign received dirty money from Bosasa, Mmusi Maimane, the leader of the main opposition party, Democratic Alliance, said.
The reports come just months before national elections are expected to be held, most likely in May. Allies of Mr. Ramaphosa, who ousted Jacob Zuma from power a year ago, are hoping that he will win a decisive victory and carry out reforms inside a fractured A.N.C.
Weve gone through a challenging number of years, nine years to be exact, where we seemed to lose our way, where we deviated from the path that you traditionally would have expected us to traverse, Mr. Ramaphosasaid last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, referring to Mr. Zumas nine-year presidency.
But Mr. Agrizzis testimony indicated that malfeasance has long been  and still is  an integral part of the A.N.C., which has held power since the end of apartheid in 1994. Corruption, he testified, long predated Mr. Zumas presidency and involves officials in Mr. Ramaphosas own cabinet and in the partys top hierarchy.
Established by leaders of the A.N.C.s Womens League, Bosasa was bought and then built up by a white South African businessman, Gavin Watson, who with his brothers became anti-apartheid heroes for playing rugby with black South Africans in the 1970s. After democracy was introduced in the 1990s, the Watsons used their links to the A.N.C. for business purposes. The company changed its name last year to African Global Operations.
Mr. Agrizzi served as Mr. Watsons right-hand man but said he was coming clean after nearly dying during heart surgery in 2016. He said Bosasas business grew thanks to ties to the A.N.C. during the government of Thabo Mbeki.
By 2009, the company was under severe scrutiny: TheSpecial Investigating Unit, a government agency, released a report detailing widespread fraud in Bosasas relations with officials overseeing the nations prisons.
But nothing came of the report or further investigations into Bosasa, Mr. Agrizzi said, because the company paid off national prosecutors and A.N.C. lawmakers on a parliamentary committee overseeing prisons.
Bosasa also bought protection from prosecutors by cultivating ties with Dudu Myeni, a close ally of Mr. Zuma, Mr. Agrizzi said. Ms. Myeni served for years as the head of South Africas now bankrupt national airline despite having no experience in the industry.
Bosasa funneled $22,000 a month to Mr. Zuma through her, Mr. Agrizzi said, adding that the money was once stuffed into a Louis Vuitton bag that sent Ms. Myeni over the moon. Mr. Zuma has not commented on the testimony.
As Bosasa sought further protection, Mr. Agrizzi said a monthly retainer was also paid to another close ally of Mr. Zuma, Nomvula Mokonyane, who was so quick in getting things done for the company that she was nicknamed the Energizer Bunny.
The company also rewarded Ms. Mokonyane  who is now Mr. Ramaphosas minister for environmental affairs  with the annual Christmas basket, and her daughter with cars, Mr. Agrizzi said.
Ms. Mokonyanes lawyers said that her right to procedural fairness had been breached by the investigating panel and that she felt betrayed that newspapers had obtained Mr. Agrizzis prepared testimony.

As commander of the coalition forces in Iraq, Maj. Gen. Walter Piatt juggled ruthless pursuit of enemies and delicate diplomacy with tribal leaders, using a trove of modern weaponry and streams of tech-generated data.
But his best decisions, he said, relied on a tool as ancient as it is powerful. Maj. Gen. Piatt often began daily operations by breathing deliberately, slack-jawed, staring steadily at a palm tree.
Mindfulness  the practice of using breathing techniques, similar to those in meditation, to gain focus and reduce distraction  is inching into the military in the United States and those of a handful of other nations.
[For more stories about the experiences and costs of war,sign up for the weekly At War newsletter.]
This winter, Army infantry soldiers at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii began using mindfulness to improve shooting skills  for instance, focusing on when to pull the trigger amid chaos to avoid unnecessary civilian harm.
The British Royal Navy has given mindfulness training to officers, and military leaders are rolling it out in the Army and Royal Air Force for some officers and enlisted soldiers. TheNew Zealand Defence Forcerecently adopted the technique, and military forces of the Netherlands are considering the idea, too.
This week, NATO plans to hold a two-day symposium in Berlin to discuss the evidence behind the use of mindfulness in the military.
A small but growing group of military officials support the techniques to heal trauma-stressed veterans, make command decisions and help soldiers in chaotic battles.
I was asked recently if my soldiers call me General Moonbeam, said Maj. Gen. Piatt, who was director of operations for the Army and now commands its 10th Mountain Division. Theres a stereotype this makes you soft. No, it brings you on point.

The approach, he said, is based onthe work of Amishi Jha, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Miami. She is the senior author of a paper published in December about the trainings effectiveness among members of a special operations unit.
The paper, in the journal Progress in Brain Research, reported that the troops who went through a monthlong training regimen that included daily practice in mindful breathing and focus techniqueswere better able to discern key information under chaotic circumstances and experienced increases in working memory function. The soldiers also reported making fewer cognitive errors than service members who did not use mindfulness.
The findings, which build on previous research showing improvements among soldiers andprofessional football playerstrained in mindfulness, are significant in part because members of the special forces are already selected for their ability to focus. The fact that even they saw improvement speaks to the power of the training, Dr. Jha said.
Theyre the best, and what theyre trying to do is the hardest, she said.
Dr. Jha has spoken to the United States Army War College and the British Parliament, and she has been a consultant to New Zealands Defence Force and military officials in the Netherlands. When the special forces do something, she said, not only does the rest of the U.S. military pay attention, but the rest of the worlds militaries pay attention.
The science shows that techniques that focus and calm the mind allow people to perform better and make them less likely to overreact to incoming stimulation  whether a flash of movement, sound or an onslaught of information on a device.
The neuroscience of mindfulness involves, in part, strengthening a part of mental capacity known as working memory  a short-term, moment-to-moment catalog of tasks understood by scientists to effectively hold only a few pieces of information at one time.
As working memory clouds through overload, decisions become jumbled and reactions more impulsive. Breathing-induced focus lets people home in on the task at hand. But it does take practice.
The recent study found that service members who train for four weeks experience significant improvement, but those who train for only two weeks do not.
The mindfulness training comes as the military is exploring other options to intensify soldier focus, even the possibility ofimplanting computer chipsinto soldiers brains. But those potential solutions are expensive and years off.
Widespread adoption of mindfulness has challenges, including creating a staff of trainers, said Commander William MacNulty, a commissioned officer in the United States Public Health Service. He helped train a special forces unit in mindfulness (the precise military branch and location are confidential). The program entailed the soldiers spending about 15 minutes each day performing recorded, guided breathing exercises.
Mr. MacNulty said that about a third of the soldiers readily embraced the idea, a third engaged with curiosity, and a third seemed skeptical.
Mr. MacNulty likened the benefits of practicing mindfulness to those of, say, doing push-ups. You might not drop and do push-ups when youre in a gunfight, but you have increased capacity, he said. Thats true of mindfulness, he added: Mental focus becomes a transferable skill.
In the newsmagazine of the Royal New Zealand Air Force, the militaryexplained the rationale behind adopting mindfulness. Referring to the national rugby team, the magazine said: The All Blacks talk about red head/blue head  red head means being in a flustered state and blue head means being calm, centred and able to make clearheaded decisions.
Research also has shown that use of mindfulnesscan help soldiers overcome post-traumatic stress disorder.
That has been the experience of Britains chief evangelist for use of mindfulness in the military, CommanderTim Boughton.
Mr. Boughton, decorated for service in many combat zones, discovered when he retired from active duty in 2008 that hed grown withdrawn and angered by the horrors hed seen: mangled civilian bodies fused together in combat zones; deaths of 48 compatriots in battle in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Falklands, Northern Ireland; ethnic cleansing, hand-to-hand stuff.
When he went to a psychiatrist in 2008, she broke down in tears after he described his experiences. Mr. Boughton discovered mindfulness after his own bout with PTSD, eventually becoming a trustee of the Oxford University Mindfulness Center.
He now starts and ends his day with five minutes of breathing exercises. He uses the technique each time he is gripped by anxiety or panic. The traumas havent disappeared, he said, but he isnt haunted by them daily. Now he can more calmly examine each terrible incident, address it and have some control over it  rather than merely reacting.
The amount of brain power it frees by not being trapped in the past or the future is incredible, Mr. Boughton said. The military is seeing the mass benefits of this.
Mr. Boughton has thought about whether mindfulness is anathema to conflict. The purists would say that mindfulness was never developed for war purpose, he said.
What he means is that mindfulness is often associated with peacefulness. But, he added, the idea is to be as faithful to compassionate and humane ideals as possible given the realities of the job.
Maj. Gen. Piatt underscored that point, describing one delicate diplomatic mission in Iraq that involved meeting with a local tribal leader. Before the session, he said, he meditated in front of a palm tree, and found himself extremely focused when the delicate conversation took place shortly thereafter.
I was not taking notes. I remember every word she was saying. I wasnt forming a response, just listening, he said. When the tribal leader finished, he said, I talked back to her about every single point, had to concede on some. I remember the expression on her face: This is someone we can work with.
In the end, he said, mindfulness allowed him to reduce conflict by better understanding.
Im not saying, be soft, he added. Im saying, understand how compassion and empathy can be used for real advantages.
Peace takes a lot of hard work.
An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the All Blacks. The phrase describes a prominent rugby team in New Zealand, not the national air force.

WELLINGTON, New Zealand  On Saturday, an Air New Zealand plane bound for Shanghai abruptly turned around in circumstances that remain unclear. Days later, the launch of a much-promoted tourism initiative planned between China and New Zealand was canceled, purportedly because of scheduling issues for Beijing, despite being planned for years.
The incidents have raised concerns that New Zealand is the latest target of Beijings scorn, a worrying prospect for a country that relies on China for 15.3 billion New Zealand dollars, or more than $10 billion, of its export trade, the most goods it sends to any country.
New Zealands prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, on Wednesday admitted challenges in her countrys relationship with China but denied that those ties were deteriorating. Her remarks came in response to claims by commentators and her political opponents that New Zealand was experiencing retaliation because it hadjoined other Western nationsby taking a tough stance against the Chinese technology company Huawei.
The perception in Beijing is that New Zealand now has uncharacteristically joined the U.S. in containing China by trying to contain its technology companies  and they are prepared to retaliate, said David Mahon, a New Zealand businessman who runs the investment management firm Mahon China and has lived in Beijing for 34 years.
He added that longtime suppliers of fresh New Zealand products to China had already faced non-tariff impediments at Chinese ports.
Amid the growing tensions, Huawei has begun an advertising campaign in New Zealand in which it appeals to the public over the governments ban on having it supply technology for the countrys fifth-generation, or 5G, mobile data network.
New Zealands largest telecommunications providerannounced in Novemberthat it would join the ranks of countries blocking the use of Huawei equipment in its 5G rollout, citing intelligence agency advice that it would present significant national security risks.
The full-page ads, which started running Wednesday in New Zealands two largest newspapers, said that 5G without Huawei was like rugby without New Zealand, referring to the countrys domination of the sport internationally.
Analysts suggested the Huawei decision might have prompted the cancellation of the tourism event, as well as Ms. Arderns apparent inability to schedule a visit to China, planned since late last year.
The Huawei ban came as a shock to Beijing, said Mr. Mahon, the businessman, who added that New Zealands reputation as an independent voice on the world stage was being eroded by its alignment with the United States over the ban, as well as its tougher language on Chinas actions in the Pacific and South China Sea.
Either we have changed our view and we want to be much closer to Washington, or this is a series of misadventures, mistakes and misunderstandings, Mr. Mahon said. But we need to qualify it soon.
New Zealand officials have rejected assertions that the governments relationship with Beijing has cooled.
The New Zealand-China Year of Tourism was due to launch next week at New Zealands national museum in Wellington, the capital. Ms. Arderntold the New Zealand news mediathat she was taking at face value Chinas explanation that the event had to be canceled because of scheduling issues.
When Im given a reason, it is not for me to question that, she said.
But Charles Finny, a former New Zealand diplomat in Beijing who now advises clients on China for the Wellington-based government relations firm Saunders Unsworth, said the cancellation was strange and might reflect some concerns on the state of the relationship.
Beijing could, for instance, discourage tourism to New Zealand or squeeze the flow of students to the countrys schools  not to mention throttling the countrys lucrative exports to China.
Id be watching very closely over the next months what our tourism numbers are showing and what our international education numbers are showing, and Id be talking to exporters to see if theyre having any increased problems at the border, Mr. Finny said.
China is New Zealands top export destination and its biggest source of foreign students.
Elizabeth Economy, the director for Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, said by email that many countries had suffered from Beijings propensity to address political and national security conflicts through economic pressure.
Among them was Norway, which hada six-year economic riftwith Beijing over the 2010 decision to award the Nobel Peace Prize to the democracy advocateLiu Xiaobo,who died in 2017.
Sometimes the pressure is significant, such as reducing the number of Chinese tourists or encouraging boycotts of products or companies, Ms. Economy said. Sometimes it is more subtle, such as simply slowing the flow of a countrys exports into China.
Mr. Mahon said that had already happened, but other analysts warned against panic. Rodney Jones, a New Zealand economist who recently returned to Auckland from Beijing after spending 30 years in Asia, said such concerns were way overwrought.
We can overstate the importance of a political relationship, he said, adding that even though Australia had spent 2018 in the diplomatic doghouse with Beijing, exports to China last year grew.
Ms. Arderns political opponents said the cancellation of the tourism launch was just one sign that the relationship between the two countries was deteriorating.
With regards to the return of the Air New Zealand plane, a spokeswoman for the carrier said in an email that the problem related to a particular aircraft which is not yet certified to operate to China but was unfortunately assigned to operate that evenings route.
Air New Zealand would not explain how the error happened, and in Parliament on Thursday, Foreign Minister Winston Peters, said the airline had made the decision to turn back on its own rather than returning on the insistence of Chinese officials, as had earlier been reported. The airline did not immediately clarify who was responsible for the decision.
Ms. Economy said that for China, such an administrative issue could have been a convenient opportunity to pile on to the other warnings Beijing is giving New Zealand around its Huawei ban.
Certainly Shanghai airport control could have allowed the airplane to land with a stiff warning, she said.
Complicating matters was an announcement by the New Zealand Police on Wednesday that they had completed an investigation into the harassment of Anne-Marie Brady, a professor at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch who studies Chinas network of influence in New Zealand. The yearlong inquiry, which also involved Interpol and New Zealands spy agency, failed to determine who broke into Professor Bradys home and office, tampered with her car or made threatening phone calls.
Professor Bradysaid in Septemberthat the thief or thieves at her home had ignored valuables in plain sight but stolen a cheap cellphone she had used in China and an old, broken laptop on which she had written a much-publicized paper on Chinas influence.
Professor Brady said she had been the target of a sustained harassment campaign by agents of Beijing. Two months ago, more than 160 China watcherssigned an open letterurging the New Zealand government to protect her.
In an email on Wednesday, she said it was disappointing but not unexpected that the culprit had not been identified.

SYDNEY  Dumping the Western Force from Super Rugby enabled Rugby Australia (RA) to post a surplus of A$5.2 million (£2.8 million) in 2018, but it could have long-term benefits, the governing body said on Monday.
RA chose to cut the Perth-based side ahead of the 2018 season following an agreement with the competition's governing body SANZAAR to reduce the number of teams as it faced a backlash from fans and broadcasters after an ill-fated decision to expand to 18 teams in 2016.
The cut saved RA about A$6.48m last year, having spent almost A$12.17m across five Super Rugby sides in 2017. In total the organisation was able to make almost A$15m in cost savings.
"One of the reasons why we went back to four (Super Rugby teams) was to improve the financial health of the organisation," RA chairman Cameron Clyne told reporters after the annual general meeting in Sydney.
"But we also needed to make the (Super Rugby) teams more competitive and in 2018 and 2019 the teams have been, so you are starting to see uplifts in broadcast (numbers) and if that continues then you see better revenue flows."
One of the major concerns facing SANZAAR was the number of uncompetitive matches that had developed in Super Rugby, which adversely affected television viewing numbers and fan engagement, he added.
Australia's playing stocks were also spread too thin across five teams, often relying on journeyman players from South Africa and New Zealand to fill out their squads.
Their sides also endured a 40-match losing streak, which lasted longer than two years, to teams from their trans-Tasman neighbours, before it was broken last May.
"We are now beating New Zealand teams in 2018 and 2019," Clyne said. "So that is a sign the teams are playing better and more attractive football."
Despite 2018 being one of their "better financial years" Clyne said lost revenue due to the Rugby World Cup in Japan later this year would see it operate at a loss in 2019.
RA expects it will face reduced domestic broadcast and matchday revenue of almost A$33 million because of the tournament, although World Rugby will offset some of those losses with a grant of A$19.4 million.
"We always make a loss in World Cup years because we play less test matches. There are only three test matches in Australia," he said.
"(But) there is no question that a World Cup year, particularly if your team does well, allows you to leverage off that.
"Hopefully we can come back with the Cup and then build off that in 2020."

Good morning.
New Zealandinvestigates how the massacre could have been avoided,Chinagets a toehold in Europe andAppleprepares to unveil its next big thing. Heres the latest:
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern orderedan inquiry into whether government agenciescould have prevented the attacks at two mosques in Christchurch on Friday that left at least 50 dead.
Her cabinet also agreed in principle to overhaul the countrys gun laws and will announce reforms within 10 days of this horrific act of terrorism, she said at a news conference.
The victims:New Zealands deputy police commissioner said specialists had worked through the night to identify the people killed at the Al Noor and Linwood mosques. Islamic leaders and victims families have been discussing holding a burial for all victims, possibly on Wednesday.
The suspect:Our reporter went to the town of Dunedin, home to the suspected gunman, and spoke to people he interacted with, including members of his rifle club.
Perspective:Our Opinion section has essays examining thetraits white supremacist terrorists have in commonand thehistory of white supremacist violence.
At least one gunman opened fire on a tram in the city of Utrecht,killing three people and injuring five more.
Officials arrested a suspect  a 37-year-old Turkish-born man  after an eight-hour manhunt, but its still unclear whether he was the only person involved in the attack.
Authorities said they were looking into the possibility the shooting was an act of terror, with the counterterrorism agency raising its threat assessment to the highest level. They had also ordered the evacuation of all mosques in the city, but its unclear if that move stems from a specific threat or as a precaution in the wake of the attack in New Zealand. But they didnt rule out other motives, and some reports suggested the attack was the result of a domestic dispute.
Context:The city of Utrecht has a large immigrant population, with more than 30 percent of residents born outside the Netherlands. The attack took place in the Kanaleneiland neighborhood, home to a large number of Muslims, including immigrants from Morocco and Turkey.
This week, President Xi Jinping isexpected to arrive in Rome to sign a dealthat would make Italy the first Group of 7 nation to participate in Beijings global Belt and Road initiative.
The deal would open Italy to greater Chinese infrastructure investment in exchange for favorable customs conditions and a faster trade route into the heart of Europe.
The vast project is already underway in the port city of Trieste. Construction workers in scuba gear have been laying foundations near the site of a new pier. Other cities up for a transformation include Genoa and Palermo.
Concerns:The U.S. and E.U. powers like Germany and France have been wary of Beijings Belt and Road project, casting it as an economic and perhaps even military threat.
Supporters of the plan in Italy, however, have few reservations, saying the countrys laws protect its autonomy.
The kingdom has a history of going after dissidents and other Saudi citizens abroad, butthe efforts escalated sharply after Prince Mohammed bin Salman was elevatedto crown prince in 2017.
The prince authorized a clandestine campaign that included the surveillance, kidnapping, detention and torture of Saudi citizens, according to American officials who have read classified reports about the efforts.
Since then, Saudi security forces have detaineddozens of clerics, intellectuals and activists who were perceived to pose a threat, as well as people who had posted critical or sarcastic comments about the government on Twitter.
Details:At least a dozen missions were carried out by the same team that killed Jamal Khashoggi in October, suggesting that the gruesome murder was part of a broader push, according to officials and associates of some of the Saudi victims.
The group behind Mr. Khashoggis killing, which American officials called the Saudi Rapid Intervention Group, also forcibly repatriated Saudis from other Arab countries and detained and abused prisoners in palaces belonging to the crown prince and his father, King Salman.
Afghanistan:Three months after the countrys soccer chief, Keramuddin Keram, was accused of sexually abusing members of the womens national team,an investigation has stalled, amid fears it will never proceed.
Britain:The speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, warned Prime Minister Theresa May thatshe could not hold a third vote in Parliament on her beleaguered Brexit planunless it was substantially different from the proposal already been rejected twice.
India:Gauri Lankesh, a journalist who railed against the right-wing Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., wasshot dead in September. We take a deep look at her story and what it reveals about the countrys increasingly intolerant politics.
The Philippines:A beached whaledied with 88 pounds of plastic trash inside its body, an unusually large amount that brought renewed attention to ocean pollution.
#MeToo:Nearly 100 female economists in the U.S. say that a peer or colleague has sexually assaulted them, and nearly 200 say they were the victims of an attempted assault,according to a new surveythat reveals deep evidence of gender and racial discrimination in the field.
Lyft:The ride-hailing app  and Ubers main rival in North America  hopes to be valued atup to $23 billion, according to filings ahead of its initial public offering, most likely the years biggest.
The Prado:As Spains national art museum celebratesits bicentennial, our writer  who has visited more than 200 times  returned to every gallery, vestibule and passageway.
Apple:The tech giants next big product isnt a new device, but a billion-dollar-plus foray into streaming video. The company isexpected to reveal details of the project next week.
Spain:A bar in Madrid celebrating the dictator Gen. Francisco Franco andcatering to the radical rightis run by a Chinese man  an irony that has not gone unnoticed by patrons. We used to joke to him, one said. If Franco was still alive, he would kill you.

We all have rivals in our work lives. Theyre our closest competitors  andthey can be our greatest allies.

New Zealanders have lit candles, piled flowers and stood vigil since a gunman attacked two mosques in Christchurch, killing at least 50 people.
They have also performed the haka.
The ceremonial dance originated with the Maori, the countrys indigenous Polynesian inhabitants. Warriors danced to intimidate opponents with grimaces, chanting and aggressive postures. But there are also hakas of welcome and hakas for funerals.
The form has been embraced by New Zealanders of all origins, most famously by the national rugby team, the All Blacks. Many schools have haka groups, and every two years, theres a national competition hosted by one of the countrys iwi, or tribes.
A variety of haka have beenperformed for the Christchurch victims. For instance, a biker group, Black Power, useda warlike haka to express solidarity.
Others performed one of the most famous hakas,Ka mate,a tribute to life in the face of death.

Mr. Trump and the German institution Deutsche Bank have had a long, symbiotic and at times troubled relationship. Now, as investigators in Washington and New York scrutinize their deals,we looked into that history.
Those inquiries come at a perilous time for Deutsche Bank, which isnegotiating to merge with Commerzbank.
Deutsche Banks hunger for profits and risk led it to lend Mr. Trump more than $2 billion before he was president, despite pushback from some at the bank. Once he was elected, the bank went into damage-control mode, bracing for public scrutiny. It even told Wall Street employees not to utter the Trump name.
Inside the bank:Deutsche Bank officials have quietly played down the relationship with Mr. Trump and said that the lending was the work of a single, obscure division. But interviews with more than 20 current and former executives and board members contradict that narrative. Readfour takeaways from our reporting.
On the year of the Prados bicentennial,our writer visited every gallery, vestibule and passageway to see whether he had missed anything on his previous 200 visits to the Madrid museum. He had.
After 12,000 steps, he found that a gallery dedicated to stunning decorated objects, displayed next to their leather cases, provided a fitting metaphor for the Prado itself: artistic perfection inside and out.
Where to start:There is no one designated route to follow through the museum, and visitors can expect to occasionally double back through galleries to move on.
Highlights:SeeHieronymus Boschs famous triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights; works by Diego Velázquez; more works by Titian, the godfather of Venetian painting, than in any other museum; more than 250 sculptures; and countless other delights.
Canada:The countrystop public servant resigned. It was the fourth prominent resignation related to accusations that the Trudeau government improperly pressed the former attorney general to settle a corruption case involving a major corporation.
Israel:A U.N. panel has urged the Israeli authorities to step up investigations into shootings of Palestinian demonstrators at the Gaza border last year,saying they may have constituted war crimes.
Cyclone:An enormous storm that struck Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, calledIdai, hasaffected more than 1.5 million people, with a death toll now in the dozens and feared to be far higher.
Afghanistan:Three months after the countrys soccer chief, Keramuddin Keram, was accused of sexually abusing members of the womens national team,an investigation has stalled amid fears that it will never proceed.
Midwest flooding:Record floods that have pummeled part of the U.S.are inflicting a devastating toll on farmers and rancherswhen they can least afford it.
Brexit:The speaker of the House of Commons haswarned Prime Minister Theresa May that she cannot hold a third voteon her plan for the countrys departure from the E.U. unless the plan undergoes substantial alterations.
Hungary:The country has effectivelygranted a Russian bank diplomatic immunityfrom any scrutiny by the police or financial regulators. Western security officials are concerned that Russian spies could use it as a base for intelligence operations.
Spain:A bar in Madrid celebrating the dictator Gen. Francisco Franco andcatering to the radical rightis run by a Chinese man  an irony that has not gone unnoticed by patrons. We used to joke to him, one said. If Franco was still alive, he would kill you.

Good morning,
Were covering the pushto limit exposure for the suspectin the New Zealand attacks, the results of a Times investigation of President Trumpslong relationship with Germanys largest bank, and a surprise inthe N.C.A.A. womens basketball field.
But he will, when I speak, be nameless.
With those words, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand said today that shewould not say the name of the man accusedof carrying out the attacks that killed 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch. She said she wanted to deny him the attention he craves.
Ms. Ardern also demanded that online platforms like Facebook do a better job of controlling hateful content. Before the attacks, the gunman published a manifesto to message boards popular with white supremacists, and included a link to a page where live video of the shooting later appeared.
Yesterday:The spokesman for the Islamic State ended nearly six months of silence incalling for retaliation over the mosque attacks.
The president and the German financial institution have had a long, symbiotic and, at times, troubled relationship. As investigators in New York and Washington scrutinize their deals,we looked into that history.
Deutsche Bank gave Mr. Trump more than $2 billion in real estate development loans before he was president, despite pushback from some at the bank. Once he was elected, the lender went into damage-control mode, even telling Wall Street employees not to utter the Trump name.
How we know:Deutsche Bank officials have said that the lending was the work of a single, obscure division. But interviews with more than 20 current and former executives and board members contradict that narrative. Readfour takeaways from our investigation.
Response:A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman said, We remain committed to cooperating with authorized investigations. The White House referred questions to the Trump Organization, a spokeswoman for which declined to comment.
Promises to expand access to health insurance and to lower health care costs were critical to the partys success in taking control of the House.
But as they draft the legislation to fulfill those promises,lawmakers are divided, with many centrist Democrats opposing the concept of single payer, now called Medicare for all, that is favored by progressives.
Closer look:Advisers for the Democratic primary fieldrepresent a more diverse and issue-driven generation.
Yesterday:Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic candidate,called for ending the Electoral College.
The record flooding that has killed at least two people is alsoa dire economic blow to farmers and ranchersalready weighed down by falling incomes, rising bankruptcies and the fallout from federal trade policies.
Floodwaters began to ebb in some parts of the Midwest on Monday, but farm groups said recovery could take months or years.
Quotable:One man in Nebraska, whose family has farmed for five generations, said, Theres not many farms left like this, and its probably over for us too, now. Financially, how do you recover from something like this?
Explainer:The governors of Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin have declared emergencies, and Iowas governor has issued a disaster proclamation. Heresa look at the science behind the flooding.
AIDS experts agree that, medically, the plan that President Trump announced in February to end the H.I.V. epidemic is sound. But the group most at risk includes gay and bisexual black men and transgender women in the Deep South, and finding and educating them about the disease is rarely easy.
Regi Stevenson, above, works at a clinic in Jackson, Miss., thatsees the challenges every day.
Michael Cohen investigation:Federal authorities began scrutinizing President Trumps former lawyer in 2017, soon after Mr. Trump took office,according to records released today.
Boeing chief speaks:In his first substantive public remarks since one of his companys jets crashed in Ethiopia, Dennis Muilenburg on Mondayextended his condolences to the loved onesof the 157 victims.
Fourth Canadian official quits:The countrys top public servant has stepped down, accused of improperly intervening in a corporate corruption case. The scandal has besieged the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Attack in the Netherlands:The Dutch police said today that they werestill considering terrorism as a motive for a deadly shootingon a tram in the city of Utrecht based partly on a note they discovered.
New York schools:Very few black students have been offeredadmission to the citys highly selective public high schools, adding pressure on officials to improve integration.
Snapshot:Above,meet the Flintstone House.The town of Hillsborough, Calif., has sued the owner to force the removal of dinosaur statues and other landscaping. It is one thing to spot this house when driving by on the freeway, a lawyer for the town said. It is a different thing to be a neighbor and see it all day, every day.
C-Span anniversary:Forty years ago today, the network went live with its first broadcast from the House.We spoke with one of C-Spans two chief executivesabout its legacy.
N.C.A.A. basketball:For the first time since 2006, Connecticutwont be a No. 1 seed in the womens tournament. In another surprise, ESPN leaked the bracket hours early on Monday. (Heres a printable version.) Baylor, Louisville, Mississippi State and Notre Dame will be the top seeds when the tournament starts on Friday.
Late-night comedy:Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that she had asked President Trump to express his sympathy and love for all Muslim communities.Stephen Colbert doubted whether that would happen.

New Zealanders have lit candles, piled flowers and stood vigil since two mosques were attacked in Christchurch last week, resulting in the death of at least 50 people.
They have also performedthe haka.
The ceremonial dance originated with the Maori, the countrys indigenous Polynesian inhabitants. Warriors danced to intimidate opponents with grimaces, chanting and aggressive postures. But there are also hakas of welcome and hakas for funerals.
The form has been embraced by New Zealanders of all origins, most famously by the national rugby team, the All Blacks. Many schools have haka groups, and a national competition is hosted every two years by one of the countrys iwi, or tribes.
A variety of haka forms have beenperformed for the Christchurch victims. For instance, a biker group, Black Power, useda warlike haka to express solidarity.
Others performed one of the most famous hakas, Ka mate, a tribute to life in the face of death.

CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand  The families drifted from the mosques to the hospital, their emotions battered, their eyes bloodshot.
More than a day had passed since the attacks on Fridaythat killed 50 peopleat two mosques in Christchurch, and many still did not know the fate of loved ones they believed were at prayer when the gunman arrived and started firing.
Akhtar Khokhar, who arrived two months ago from India to visit her son, had come to the hospital for answers.
This is my husband, she said, holding up a photo before an imam who was at Christchurch Hospital to try to help family members. He shook his head with uncertainty.
Others faced similar frustrations, with no firm answers about who had died.
This is the best they can do? asked Zuhair Darwish, as his brothers wife in Jordan kept calling, desperate, wanting to know whether to plan a funeral.
Hours before, the gunman who had inflicted all this pain was charged with one count of murder, with dozens more expected.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who flew to Christchurch to visit with families, vowed that our gun laws will change  now is the time. Minutes before the shooting began on Friday, Ms. Ardern was emailed a copy of the racist manifesto purported to be from the gunman.
[Read live updates here from New York Times journalists in Christchurch.]
On Saturday evening, Mr. Darwish, like many others, still could not believe where the horror had landed him: in a hospital cafeteria, renamed a relatives room, that was crowded with grief and hot with anger.
Dozens of family members  teenagers in T-shirts, grandmothers in head scarves, bearded men in jeans  were there, squeezed together and pressing for information from overwhelmed officials.
Its illegal to hide the names from us! Mr. Darwish shouted at a police official, who was fielding questions while standing on a chair at the back of the room, where few could hear him. You have to provide them!
This was not where they belonged, many of the survivors said.
Bloodshed, terrorism and fear were what some of them had left behind, fleeing countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan and Somalia. Others were born here, used to relative quiet and peace. But in the land of emerald green rugby pitches, hatred found them all anyway.
[Go here to read how the attack unfolded on Friday.]
They responded with the full range of human emotion. Walking between the mosques and the hospital revealed countless examples of tears and outrage. There was debilitating sadness. There was confusion, but also the kind of love you see in hugs that hold tight and bring tears without concern for who is looking.
This is a test, said Zia Aiyaz, 32, an engineer originally from Afghanistan who flew to Christchurch from Hamilton, New Zealand, to help the families of those who were killed or wounded. God is testing us  testing the families and us, and were here to help.
Islamfirst arrived in Christchurch in 1854, with a family from India, local history says. Its roots strengthened in the 1970s with the arrival of Afghan immigrants, and again in the 90s with new arrivals from other countries.
The Muslim community is neither highly visible nor invisible here in Christchurch, a pleasant city of 350,000 near the South Islands Pacific Coast. Mostly Sunni, they are part of a small but growing group of around 46,000 Muslims overall in a country of 4.6 million. In Christchurch, their ranks include students at local universities, taxi drivers, professionals, nurses  and imams like Lateef Alabi.
A leader at the Linwood Mosque, he is originally from Nigeria but is also close to finishing a Ph.D in Malaysia. He has been in New Zealand for three years.
On Saturday, he moved briskly between all the areas where families had gathered, having changed into a clean, gray dishdasha robe. His garment from the day before had been stained with blood.
He often found that he had little to offer those in need.
When Ms. Khokhar found him, and told him her husband had been at Al Noor Mosque, he shook his head and just said, Oh no. That was where 41 people had been killed.
Many of those who attended prayers on Friday were regulars, for whom Islamic practice was woven into engaged lives in the city.
Yasir Amin Nasr, 35, who moved from Lahore, Pakistan, five years ago, now works for the Christchurch City Council. He and his father, Muhammad Amin Nasr, had parked their car up the road from Al Noor Mosque on Friday and were walking toward the building when they first heard gunfire.
After another burst of gunshots, he pleaded with his father to run away, and quickly. But it was too late.
Two, three seconds, he was just in front of us, pointing the gun at us, Mr. Nasr said, trying to show a distance of some eight yards separating them from the gunman.
I saw him. He looked at us, Mr. Nasr said. He was driving. He stopped the car when he spotted us and he got his gun.
Mr. Nasr said the gunman aimed the weapon across the drivers side of the car, through the passenger window toward him and his father and began firing.
His father was hit twice. On Saturday night, he was in critical condition in Christchurch Hospital.
His father, a regular traveler to New Zealand, had arrived three weeks ago for this latest visit and had planned to stay for longer than usual.
He likes it here, Mr. Nasr said. He said he would stay for at least one year because of peace, because here he has nothing to worry about, he can just relax.
More might have died at the Linwood Mosque but for the selfless actions of Abdul Aziz, 48, who was praying there with his four sons when he heard gunshots.
Rather than fleeing, he ran toward the sound and grabbed the first thing he could find  a credit card machine  and tossed it at the attacker. He then tried to draw the gunmans attention to himself, and away from other worshipers, by weaving through cars in the parking lot.
Mr. Alabitold The Associated Presshe believed the death toll would have been far higher without Mr. Azizs actions.
Mr. Aziz, originally from Afghanistan, said he saw the attacker drop one of his guns and managed to grab it. But when he pulled the trigger, the gun was empty. When the gunman went to his car, presumably to grab more ammunition, Mr. Aziz said he threw the gun at the assailants windshield, shattering the glass. The assailant sped away.
Perhaps because of where the shooting took place  a country where there are fewer than a dozen murders in some years  many of the survivors found themselves reaching back in time, using words like peace and quiet, calm and safety.
Mr. Darwish, 40, said that was how he persuaded his brother, Kamel, to move to New Zealand from Jordan: I told him its the safest country in the world and the best place to raise kids.
He was here for six months, he added. He was going to bring his wife in a month.
Instead, Kamel was missing and presumed dead.
Inside the hospitals relatives room, Mr. Darwish could not contain his frustration. Several relatives had to walk him outside to help him calm down when a local imam he didnt know stood up and tried to explain that they were trying to wait until all the names had been confirmed and all the bodies identified before sharing information with the group.
We want connectivity, said the imam, Mustafa Farouk. So everyone gets closure at the same time.
Others in the crowd demanded an alternative, something quicker so we can rest! shouted one man in a far corner.
Mr. Farouk explained that some of the victims were unrecognizable because of their wounds. Another imam reminded them that its not a car accident, its an international crime scene, and that officials had to be careful not to get anything wrong.
Still, the crowd pleaded: Let people share photos. Let imams who know some of the dead identify them.
For a time, the pain brought division. Then the discord was broken when a man shouted Allahu akbar!  God is great  and called for patience.
A few minutes later, officials announced that they would not wait for all the bodies to be identified. They acceded to the communitys demands and let people send photos to the police and choose imams to identify those they could.
The survivors knew this victory would only bring more pain. But at least they were moving toward a resolution, together and alone.

At a time of identity crisis for London, many designers, including Craig Green, and Hussein Chalayan, defiantly flew the flag for British mens wear.
ByElizabeth Paton
LONDON  The arrival of the new year has done little to quell the nerves about a London in flux. The economic and political future of Britain remains uncertain, and thebattle over how the country should leave the European Unioncontinues to rage.
It has prompted an identity crisis that spilled over into the first of the coming round of fashion shows, which began on Friday with London Fashion Week Mens. After all, the old narrative of London as a global metropolis was an identity deeply woven into its designs.
So it was of little surprise that, last weekend, passionate questions around authentic presentations of self and voice, as well as explorations of artifice and mirage, were front and center on the runway. Heres what shone through.
This season, the stakes were raised by some of the brightest young talents on the fashion week calendar: recognition, perhaps, of a need to boost their credibility outside of their home base.

Case in point:Charles Jeffrey Loverboy. The latest collection, entitled Darling Little Sillies and showcased in a dilapidated Victorian power station on the banks of the River Thames, was inspired by a first edition of The Story of Peter Pan, with a heady dose of 1920s cabaret culture thrown in.
Amid prancing actors, shattered chandeliers and bathtubs filled with books, came bold, oversize tartan suits and exquisite embroidered coats; colorful graphic mohair sweaters; and dramatic scarlet evening gowns, either one-shouldered with a dropped waist or sleeveless with a full tiered skirt.
Mr. Jeffreys prodigious talent was visible in both cut and construction, as was an effort to make his often outrageous styles more accessible.
The same could not be said ofArt School, the gender non-binary collective that this season graduated from the bosom of Fashion East, a talent incubator. The designers Eden Loweth and Tom Barratt said they had been picturing models on the way to the opera, but it was still hard to imagine the exuberant explosion of silk slips, wobbly stilettos, hacked-up sweatshirts and bottom-skimming metallic tuxedos as actual clothes.
More commercial wasEdward Crutchley, who showed a highly appetizing collection he termed business wear with bite and expensive elegance. Think sleek tailored evening looks for both sexes including pinstriped suits and luxurious cashmere knits, printed lounge pajamas and silky cigarette pants; all careful, considered and admirably grown-up.
And then there was Samuel Ross ofA-Cold-Wall, the most recent recipient of the Fashion Awards prize for British Emerging Mens Wear Designer and one of the most-watched names on the London scene.
Like Mr. Jeffrey, Mr. Ross has stepped things up a notch while looking to the news cycle. His show was inspired, in part, by the immigration crisis and the movement of people across bodies of water in Europe.
Models came down a runway adrift in inky black water, surrounded by growling dogs and dancers who slinked and sighed in the shadows. Constantly looking over their shoulders, they wore versions of the sportswear that has become this brands signature  hoodies, macs, protective utility vests and tailored tracksuits in muted tones  with reflective piping and compasses sewn into garments.
Fashion has overdone nostalgia in an attempt to cash in on your impossible longing for a perfect you and perfect time, that doesnt exist now and actually never did. So read the show notes ofLiam Hodges, a London mens wear favorite, whose kaleidoscopic collection of tracksuits and T-shirts was inspired by the growing pains of modern day cyborgs, touching on ideas around evolving online and offline identities.
It was a theme also plumbed byCottweiler, designed by Matthew Dainty and Ben Cottrell. Their latest collection, presented 12 levels down in a dank East End car park alongside moss-covered urinals, was a lament about the decline in face-to-face interaction (specifically cruising in parks), thanks to the rise of social media.
Techy tracksuits and multipocket outerwear in verdant hues, laden with cheeky touches like open flies, midriff hints and bottom-skimming zips, were framed by a 10-piece capsule collection of sleek raincoats made with the Italian label Allegri.
Hussein Chalayan, who celebrates his 25th anniversary in the fashion business this year, embraced his own next stage with tailoring  experimental origami-style folds and wide-cut padded jackets with kimono sleeves  as well as tongue-in-cheek, class-infused active wear from the worlds of equestrianism and après-ski. It neednt all be bad, these clothes seemed to say, at a time when nothing is quite as it appears.
Pretense healthily lifts us away from our reality, Mr. Chalayan said, adding a richness to the monotony of our lives.
Also adding richness:Craig Greens return to the schedule after a brief Florentine sojourn at Pitti in Italy in June. His beautiful designs rooted around timeless, nomadic men continue to earn him admiration (he won British Designer of the Year mens wear at the Fashion Awards in December for the third year in a row).
Belted trench coats in black, blues and earthy reds had an enveloping, cocoon-like quality, while a series of long-sleeved tees and trousers in tightly elasticated plastic scales came with billowing hoods to match. The point being traditions did not need to be forgotten  there were ancient knitwear techniques woven into almost every look  even if the focus remains moving forward.
Also returning: Patrick Grant ofE-Tautz,who in recent years swapped the runway for simplerpresentations. He had travel on his mind, namely to Brazil, which inspired the exotic pops of color in his elegant collection of single- and double-breasted jackets and slouchy, wide-leg pants. They were suave, well-cut clothes with a sense of gentlemanly confidence, an underrepresented aesthetic on the current calendar lineup.
Christopher Raeburncelebrated his 10th anniversary this season by revisiting and reimagining some of his most popular creations  fitting given his brands remade, reduced, recycled ethos.
Staples of his utilitarian street wear aesthetic, like typhoon suits, oversize khaki parkas and patchwork tracksuits, were shown in new and innovative materials on an army of models. There were also collaborations: with Range Rover (premium sunglasses) and Margot Vaaderpass, a fellow Royal College of Art designer (roll-neck knitwear made from recycled yarn), to demonstrate the power in numbers.
David Beckham, an owner ofKent and Curwen, the British heritage mens wear brand, wheeled out his wife, Victoria; his eldest son, Brooklyn; and other key members of the clan for a slap-up breakfast on Sunday morning, the better to debut a capsule collaboration with the BBC television series Peaky Blinders.
There were classic three-piece tweed suits, signature collarless shirts, and peg-leg wool trousers  all in autumnal tones  alongside a motley mix of rugby shirts, Crombie coats, argyle sweaters and striped skinny suits. Also flat caps, which, Mr. Beckham admitted, I got from my granddad. I wore his from a very young age.
And now? Brooklyn has taken it on as well.
An earlier version of this article misstated the number of consecutive years that Craig Green has won British Designer of the Year for mens wear at the Fashion Awards. When he won in December, it was the third year in a row.

LONDON  In theory at least, we understand the words on the sports radio we hear incessantly  in taxis, at the fish and chips place, at the corner newsstand. But we are foreigners here and the stories are inscrutable, full of happenings from cricket ovals and rugby pitches.
Our sports focus is confined to our darkened living room, where my 7-year-old son, Leo, and I have lately been absorbing improbable happenings from the other side of the Atlantic  one exhilarating victory after another for our suddenly mighty Brooklyn Nets.
This has become our early-morning ritual. Wife and daughter still asleep, the boys watch the action from the night before, the scores carefully hidden from our N.B.A. League Pass app lest we ruin the ending.
We are basketball expatriates, two steps removed from the initial source of my N.B.A. obsession by a change of team loyalties and a move to London.
In our North London surroundings, we may as well be rooting for a badminton team from Bhutan. While the odd LeBron James jersey can be spotted, our Brooklyn Nets gear seemingly fades into the sea of Yankees caps brought home by tourists returning from New York (oblivious to the hate they are inspiring from this Mets fan) and the endless Brooklyn-related mumbo jumbo that now adorns T-shirts worldwide.
[Nets Run to the Playoffs Hits a Snag With Spencer Dinwiddie Injury]
While N.F.L. gear is a common sighting, owing to the constant staging of American football games here, N.B.A. basketball is largely invisible. One imagines this was unaltered by the recent showdown of two of the leagues most dreadful teams, the Knicks and the Washington Wizards, inside Londons unlovable O2 arena. (We did not attend, just as we do not take leisure trips to see the dentist.)
Our sports-related conversations with Britons tend to revolve around the astronomical ticket prices required to see Arsenal, the English Premier League soccer team Leo has decided that we love forever. Our Nets fandom is like membership in a secret society, whose disclosure would mark us as eccentric and produce puzzlement.
Even my Knick fan friends back in New York do not want to hear about the Nets via email. My only real communion comes via obscure Nets-related podcasts I listen to while washing the dishes. When Bill Simmons and Zach Lowe devoted perhaps 3 minutes of a recent pod to the Nets surge, I confess to feelings of pride and validation I can only liken to a U.F.O. conspiracy theorist hearing that the government is probing the sighting of a flying saucer.
My embrace of the Nets began seven years ago when the Knicks  the only team I had ever rooted for  shunned a gift from the basketball gods by letting Jeremy Lin leave town. It was the final indignity after years of atrocious basketball. I dumped my Knicks season tickets and adopted the fledgling club whose arena had just risen over my Brooklyn neighborhood.
I did not do so lightly. As a born-and-bred New Yorker, I saw abandoning a team as a serious breach of the tribal code. I disdained fans from other cities who rooted for two teams in the same sport. I was unremittingly harsh to the worst transgressor of all: the bandwagon fan. (If that Steph Curry jersey you own was the first Warriors gear in your closet, yes, Im talking about you.)
But I was hopping on no bandwagon. With the exception of a pair of distant trips to the N.B.A. finals, the New Jersey-turned-Brooklyn Nets were a pathetic franchise. I was living in Brooklyn. My father had grown up in Queens and traveled on a streetcar to watch theDodgers at Ebbets Field. I was not abandoning my tribe. I was returning to it.
This is what I told myself as I began reading about the odd collection of players I was now rooting for, trying to divine the narrative that would make it real. I fought through a sense of exile in the slick, new Barclays Center, which was full of fans for whom the game itself appeared peripheral to the cool Brooklyn food, the dancing during timeouts, and whatever fascinating things were happening on their phones.
Yes, it was a gorgeous arena with excellent sightlines and welcoming staff. The season tickets I bought the day the Knicks said goodbyeto J-Linput me in seats that were a 10-minute walk from my house in Prospect Heights. Madison Square Garden was a cramped dump reached via a creaking subway and a walk through the bowels of Penn Station.
Yet there was something about the Garden, even as the Dolan era yielded a lost decade of basketball. The crowd understood. Hustle plays drew appreciation in an arena that had revered Charles Oakley. The energy was electric.
In Brooklyn, the mostly mercenary fans got what we deserved: a team of past-their-prime castoffs imported by the bombastic Russian magnate, Mikhail Prokhorov, who had brought the franchise to Brooklyn. Vowing to spend whatever it took to eclipse the Knicks  a low bar  he built a bonfire of money at the corner of Flatbush and Atlantic.
In came the wildly overpaid Joe Johnson, a seven-time All-Star. In came the mediocre Gerald Wallace in exchange for a first-round pick that Portland turned into Damian Lillard. The centerpiece was the sullen, out-of-shape Deron Williams who, in another lifetime, looked like the best point guard on earth, and whose passions no longer appeared to include basketball.
They fit uneasily around the likable 7-footer, Brook Lopez, whose sweet shooting came along with rebounding and defensive skills that seemed better suited for other pursuits, like calligraphy.
My history as a Knicks fan made the plan feel familiar. Win now, baby! The future was for losers. The oligarch was buying his way to competitiveness pronto. Leaving no doubt, the Nets soon traded every first-round pick until the sun dies for theremains of Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett.
When it all unraveled and the Nets descended into an unwatchable state, I hung in. You can not renounce the team of your life and then walk away from your new one because they are terrible. Real fandom is forged in suffering. Even when my family traded Brooklyn for London in 2016, we remained Nets fans.
This happily coincided with another development: The Nets bucked the conventional wisdom that New York fans will not accept rebuilding and embraced patience.
Sean Marks, the general manager, somehow turned a collection of mostly indifferent veterans into a raffish crew of young, hungry players led by a first-time head coach, Kenny Atkinson. They run at a ferocious pace, share the ball with grace, and play with joy.
Since an excruciating eight-game losing streak, the Nets have won 18 of 23. Even from afar, we can tell that the intensity has changed at the Barclays, the Brooook-Lyyyyn chants filling our London living room.
And still, an intense New York team deserves better. Back for the holidays, I took Leo to see New Orleans and their marquee star, Anthony Davis, at Barclays. The place was packed with tourists who seemed intent on taking selfies and buying Brooklyn gear at the swag shop.
Whatever.
On Saturday morning, we will sit on the couch in our pajamas, Leo and me, and see what happened against the now-hated, if pitiful, Knicks the night before.
Please dont tell us who won.

The Ethicist
ByKwame Anthony Appiah
I have decided to stop watching football given the recent findings about the frequency with which concussions occur and the long-term effects of those concussions on the players. I am not trying to take a stand and change any of my familys or friends opinions, but I do want to feel like Im doing my part.
Can I still follow my team in some way, though? Im a Jets fan (O.K., maybe Im not giving up much by not watching), and I really like keeping up with their season. What involvement with the team would be ethical? Can I read up on the team in the newspaper? What if I walk into a restaurant and a game is on television? Is it O.K. if I watch it there? After all, theyve chosen to play, and maybe I should respect that.Name Withheld
A body ofresearch suggests that football causes long-term brain damage in many players. Still, as you point out, the players are in a position to decide for themselves whether they want to run the risks. Those who do well in the sport expect to earn more money and more glory than they would in another endeavor. So you could just think this puts the responsibility on them. If theyre rational, they are, in effect, making the judgment that they are better off playing than not, even with a serious prospect of incurring chronic traumatic encephalopathy (C.T.E.), not to mention other chronic injuries and conditions.
Thats not the end of the discussion, though. When it comes to exposing workers to hazards, our views arent straightforward. Bureau of Labor Statistics from 2016 show 24,650 nonfatal injuries among construction workers, 28,740 injuries among local law-enforcement officers, 80,180 injuries among those for whom driving is part of their job. If you choose to be a roofer rather than a groundskeeper and accept a greater risk of injury for more pay, were O.K. with that. But the reason we have OSHA standards is that we think measures to abate hazards should be taken where feasible. The potential for grievous injury is surely part of why people watch Nascar races; we still expect drivers to use six-point harnesses and flame-retardant suits.
It isnt obvious how this principle should be applied to a game like football. Some think that new high-tech helmets will help; others argue that no helmets at all would be safer, because (as in rugby) it might discourage head collisions. Players spend much more time in practice than in actual games, and some think that practice needs to be reformed to avoid the subconcussive impacts that have been linked to C.T.E. Theres more research to be done, more rethinking of the rules of the game. Players who lower their heads and initiate helmet contact can now be penalized, and maybe theres a way to expand that penalty category. The existing penalties can certainly be increased and made more of a deterrent. Shortening the preseason could help, too. But if you really care about the welfare of football players, you should want not just to turn your back on bad practices but also to advocate for better ones.
A utilitarian, who assesses actions by their effects, would point out that nothing youre proposing to do contributes to that effort. You can avoid newspaper coverage or screens in sports bars, but given your refusal to urge anyone else to refrain from attending or watching games, that gesture will be undetectable to the football authorities, not to mention sports journalists, and puts no pressure on them. (At least in picking the Jets to follow youve made it easier to skip every Super Bowl, from which fate seems to have decided they would be excluded for the past half-century.)
But again, thats not the end of the discussion. Might there be a reason to shun a harmful activity even if doing so wont have beneficial effects? There are two lines of argument to consider here: one associated with Immanuel Kant and the other with Aristotle. A Kantian test for assessing an action is to consider whether it flows from a principle that youd have reason to want everyone to follow. Lets suppose everyones boycotting football would lead to swift changes to make the game much safer or even bring the sport to an end. (Here, the utilitarian would note that the end of football might lead to worse lives for those who now play the game at all levels and to the loss not just of a lot of pleasure among fans but also of jobs for commentators, stadium staff, officials and the like.) You can still wonder whether that Kantian strategy of the universalized maxim matters if, in the real world, none of your sports-fan friends are going to follow your lead.
One reason to refrain from fandom is simply that you may not want to be the sort of person who takes pleasure in a game that is causing serious and unnecessary harm to its players. An approach to ethics that focuses on what kind of person you are  so-called virtue ethics  is often associated with Aristotle. It tends to judge action in terms of character, rather than the other way around, and you hear its echoes in a familiar formula of reproval: What kind of person would ... ?
Let me offer a final consideration: In following the game, in joining the culture that sustains football, in its current form, as an American institution, you are not causing harm directly  but you are, in a sense, participating in causing harm. Youve been enlisted in a collective action that you view with disapproval. In this regard, you can be part of the problem, even if the problem would persist if you werent.
My husband and I are struggling to conceive. Weve been seeing a fertility specialist and going through cycles of treatment. We started with oral medications, to which unfortunately I stopped responding. We have since moved on to injectable medications. If this doesnt work, well at some point have to start thinking about IVF.
Though I desperately want to have a baby of our own, Im struggling with whether it is ethical to go through the rather incredible lengths to get pregnant that IVF requires when there are children who urgently need homes. I know that the cost of adoption, and the difficulty of actually successfully adopting a baby, make it likely as emotionally grueling (and more expensive than) as an IVF cycle. Still, the effort would go to providing a home for a baby who needs one.
More pressing is the number of children in the foster-care system. Weve talked about fostering children in the future, but in our minds that would occur after wed had some experience parenting. I do not feel that right now we could take on the enormous responsibility of foster care. I do feel we are ready for a baby of our own; children in foster care generally need a great deal more than a new baby does.
The bottom line is this: Though I want to have a biological child, and my husband definitely does want to go to IVF if it comes to that, I am struggling to wrap my head around going through so much intervention when we could instead take in a child who needs a home.
Am I off base here, or do we have a duty to give homes to children who need them when we cant easily have children of our own?Name Withheld
Taking on achild who already exists and needs a home is an enormously worthy thing to do, if youre confident that you can bond with him or her and create a loving environment. But you dont have a duty to adopt one. There are many things we each could do  such as being a parent to one of the hundred thousand or so foster children in this country who need a new family  that would improve the world. But morality doesnt demand that we do all the good we can. If you had a duty to adopt a foster child, it wouldnt be enormously worthy, just required.
Plenty of couples want to conceive but would choose to have no children rather than adopt a foster child. Thats essentially the position youre in: You dont feel prepared to provide foster care. It follows that a child you and your husband might have together wouldnt be depriving a foster child of a home. And youre not obliged to remain childless.

LONDON  In the British capital, it is the calm before the storm. The countrys scheduled departure from the European Union  Brexit  is mere weeks away, although no deal has been reached. And so little is clear about what will become of Britain in the wake of its decision to Leave that many people seem resigned to the uncertainty of the moment. There is a tempest bearing down. But until then?
Until then, it is London Fashion Week, which wrapped up its biannual round on Tuesday.
Fashion is a multibillion-dollar industry in Britain, and a global one: It can neither afford to grind to a halt for Brexit nor afford to ignore it.
Theres nothing we can really do, Molly Goddard said after her show in answer to the inevitable questions. We have a lot of European partners but beyond that I dont really know. Ms. Goddards signature are many-tiered tulle dresses, candy-pink confections that can each require 200 feet or more of fabric  the lady as layer cake  but this season she showed them undergirded with trousers and boots beneath, and balaclavas above. Everything was meant to be stomped in, she said.
Like the Boy Scouts say: Be prepared. Ms. Goddard, whose dresses can look princess-y, has always understood that there is no inherent contradiction between sweetness and strength. Not for nothing is one of her most famous customers Villanelle, the deadly assassin in Killing Eve. (Never mind that Villanelles fictional.)

It is unfair to demand that designers reflect the politics of the moment in their work, and unfair to ask them to be spokespeople for the decisions of government ministers. Yet the question bubbled up again and again over the course of five days in London, in the backstage scrums where they faced the press and explained their work: Dont youhateBrexit? said a voice from the crowd that was facing down Riccardo Tisci, Burberrys chief creative officer, on Sunday under the hot, sharp glare of the lights at the Tate Modern following his second show for the brand.
I cannot answer, Mr. Tisci said. Everyone has a different opinion, of course.
But he had called his show Tempest. And he had just finished opining that we need the younger generation to be more free, and express themselves. He felt there had been greater freedom 20 years earlier, when he was studying at Central St. Martins. But two days before, London schoolchildren had skived off classes  Americans call it cutting, but the Britishism really captures the sense better to noisily protestinaction on climate change in the streets. It seemed Mr. Tisci was the less-free one, practicing the diplomatic parry of the corporate steward.

He has, after all, a behemoth to consider. Burberry aspires to be all things to all people, and Mr. Tisci ticked off the strength he felt the label deserves to have: not only fashion, but accessories, evening wear, streetwear, underwear, expensive clothes, affordable clothes. (All things being relative: Burberry T-shirts, like the one Mr. Tisci was wearing, can cost $390.)
To me, Burberry is lifestyle, he said. Its not a fashion label. It represents a lifestyle. And it represents a country.
With a remit that broad, it only makes sense that he based his collection on the idea of including, not excluding things. In the Tate, he divided his show space into two: one room, concrete, grimly lit, with chain-link fence; the other a kind of private theater with gleaming wood and cushioned seats. The tough and the posh.
He divided the collection along the same lines. There was a streetwear section of rugby shirts and puffers, trainers and track pants. Then came the bourgeois: the good old Burberry trench, fluty dresses, trailing scarves. (It would be nearly impossible to mistake one for the other, but if, say, you were viewing from space, the hair was the tell: gorgeous, elaborate curlicues more or less tattooed to the models foreheads for the street; sober, severe buns for the rest, snug in their own little nets.)
It had more sharpness and more bite thanMr. Tiscis first collection for Burberry, which was washed-out in a medley of dutiful beige. But it nevertheless had more of the attitudes of aggression (familiar to Mr. Tiscis fans from his years at Givenchy) than real snap. For all its enormous breadth, it felt more styled than meant, a tempest that would fit neatly in a teapot.
Mr. Tisci played with references of Cool Britannia, rave and chav (British for lout), and the vaunted DNA of Burberry  a word fashion executives love to use, in an eerily eugenic way. But the effort to be everything to everyone is enervating, and no doubt exhausting. Its no secret in the industry that lifestyle is the lifeblood of the business: Those that cant afford or cant wear luxury runway fashion have to be invited in with a T-shirt, a boxer brief, a perfume, a handbag, a keychain. But is that effort killing fashion?
Im sorry. Thats grouchy.
Its not Mr. Tiscis fault that fashion has grown so giant. Lifestyle is the general ambition.
It is clearly Victoria Beckhams. But then, shes already a lifestyle. Ms. Beckham is an icon in a truer sense of the word than is usually meant by the terms constant invocation  images of her are studied and revered  and she has built up a line offering women a way to dress like her.

This fall, after a trial run with Estée Lauder, she intends to introduce her own makeup collection. And at a preview at her studio in West London a few days before her show, she said that skin care will follow after that.
So when a bright red she called lipstick red rippled through the collection, you got what she was gesturing at. But it went down gently because Ms. Beckham delivered a collection, on a sunny Sunday morning at the Tate Britain, that was focused, appealing and, most importantly, real: suits and nipped-waist blazers, slouchy trousers and longish skirts, dresses and coats and muzzy knits that women could wear. Not only out but in: Into the office, into the lunch meeting, into the Tube.
We know my customer, Ms. Beckham said, and for a change, you believed it.

Fantasy predominates at fashion week, often fabulously so. When Joan Collins finally comes scampering into an Erdem show half an hour past its scheduled start gasping, I was stuck in the lift!, you pinch yourself. Is this a dream? When Christopher Kane designs a collection around balloon fetishists and latex kinksters, looners and rubberists, you pinch yourself  or worse. (Im not here to judge.)
But throughout London, the strongest impressions were made by clothes that seemed destined to go farther than the runway and Instagram, more life than lifestyle. No disrespect to the palliative power of fantasy but, with tempests on the horizon, the real way may be the wise way.
Away from the hamster wheel of hype are designers who have been working away steadily for decades, artists of the small detail and subtle tweak. Margaret Howell is one of those: After more than 40 years in business, she remains so discreet and so untroubled by the need for acclaim that you could spot her (if youcouldspot her) casually chatting, unrecognized, in the stairwell to her show space as dozens of guests there to see her show streamed obliviously past. But her collection was filled with pieces you would be glad to own, their proportions ever so slightly improved. Hussein Chalayan, who celebrateshis 25th anniversaryin business this year, is another: He has a wonderful way of reworking something you know  a white shirt, an unstructured blazer  into something recognizable but new, so you see it fresh.
Real women, real clothes. They were there at Simone Rocha, whose show was all the more affecting for its casting of models of different ages and different sizes, just as her real clients are. When Chloë Sevigny came ambling down the runway, smiling, it didnt feel like a stunt, any more than when Jeny Howorth or Jade Parfitt or Tess McMillan followed. Ms. Rochas collection has a place for them all.
And real clothes were at J.W. Anderson, who often strays into hinterlands of the esoteric. He didnt here, although he also didnt dull himself into normalcy either. Jonathan Anderson said he wanted to take the noise out and focus on clothing, and the collection was a reminder that he can: That behind the theatrics and the riddles that sometimes dog his efforts are often very good clothes. Here they were on dazzling display, in particular, his beautiful wrap coats and puddling trousers.

Its tempting to think of Mr. Anderson floating above it all, especially when he said that he had designed his set, with its little rocks poking out of cream-colored carpet to suggest mountaintops poking through the clouds  as if his models were sailing over the sky, safe from the storm. But this was a much more grounded collection for Mr. Anderson, and all the better for it.
Shows like that put me in a good mood, Sidney Toledano, the chairman and chief executive of the LVMH Fashion Group, a minority stakeholder in the brand, whispered to Mr. Anderson.
Little else at the moment may be clear but this: I felt the same.

He was part coach, part therapist, part motivational speaker and part name dropper. Like a traveling salesman, he sought out clients near and far, selling dreams of prosperous futures.
In central Illinois, William Singer made a passionate pitch to local business executives who came by invitation to a hotel meeting room. In Sacramento, he addressed rapt audiences of parents at private schools. He twice spoke to well-heeled employees at Pimco, the giant investment management firm based in Newport Beach, Calif.
His message was confident and concise: He knew the secret to getting into college.
He was well dressed, he was well spoken, he had a PowerPoint, said Eric Webb, a father of two who drove to Champaign, Ill., from Peoria in 2012 to hear Mr. Singer talk about building childrens brands, leveraging their talents and finding the schools of their dreams.
Intrigued, Mr. Webb hired Mr. Singer to prepare his son and daughter for college, paying him at least $5,000 a year for several years of monthly visits to dole out sage advice.
But even as Mr. Webbs teenage son began counseling sessions with Mr. Singer in 2012, federal prosecutors say, Mr. Singer was simultaneously bribing a college tennis coach on the East Coast and setting up a foundation on the West Coast to camouflage bribes from rich parents.
Mr. Singer, 58, became the mastermind of an enormous, elaborate scheme carried out over years, brazenly paying off coaches and test monitors, faking exam scores and fabricating student biographies, prosecutors say  all to help wealthy parents cheat their childrens way into desirable colleges.
[Your questions about the college admission scandal answered.]
Thirty-three parents have been charged in the case, and more indictments may be on the way. Mr. Singer, who pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other counts last week, has claimed on his website that he had thousands of clients, though it is unclear how many of them he helped to break the rules.
As news of the charges spread, some of Mr. Singers former clients around the country said they were stunned and shaken. To them, Mr. Singer, who was known as Rick, had always been strategic and unabashedly pushy, but they said they had never heard him suggest breaking a law.
He was a great mentor to me, said Dylan Klumph, a college football player who said Mr. Singer counseled him.
Mr. Singer worked in the college counseling business for much of three decades, but he appeared to reach a pivot point around 2011. The earliest in the long list of his deceptions that investigators have traced so far, outlined in more than 200 pages of court documents, date back to that year.
[Heres a history of college admissions schemes, from encoded pencils to paid stand-ins.]
Around the same time, Mr. Singer was moving to a new house in a flashier community in Southern California; starting a charitable foundation that prosecutors say was used as a clearinghouse for bribes; and frenetically seeking out clients in cities across the country.
Those who knew Mr. Singer described him in interviews as a man constantly on the move, in and out of airports, hotels, boardrooms and living rooms. He was selling himself  a trim former athlete with salt-and-pepper hair who bragged about his connections in college admission offices and his encyclopedic knowledge of the higher-education landscape. He sold copies of his self-published guide to college admissions with a close-up of his face on the cover.
Mr. Singer, whose representatives did not respond to interview requests, carefully cultivated networks of parents around the country  typical middle-class families in Illinois, business moguls and celebrities in Los Angeles, and even professional athletes  who used his college counseling services and invited him into their homes and inside their deepest worries.
They all wanted the same thing: An answer to the vexing question of how to beat the odds at selective schools that turn away as many as 20 applicants for every one they accept.
He was like the Pied Piper, said Dorothy Missler, a former administrator at a Jesuit school in Sacramento who had an encounter with Mr. Singer about 20 years ago. He played the music, and they followed him down the lane.
In the Sacramento of the 1990s, Mr. Singer was not just an ambitious up-and-comer, but a pioneer.
Margie Amott, a certified educational planner in Sacramento, said she was a volunteer at a public school in the mid-1990s when Mr. Singer spoke at a college-night event. He was discussing his services as an admissions consultant, a relatively unusual occupation in those days, when college competition was fierce but had not yet exploded out of control.
He was the first consultant of this type in Sacramento, she recalled. He was persuasive, articulate and implied he knew the tricks, and that he could really help kids get an edge to get into college. I refer to him as a master salesman. He was a great pitcher. He was believable.
Mr. Singer was a somewhat unlikely messenger. In his own youth, he appeared to display neither wealth nor connections as he bounced from a Catholic university to a community college, before eventually graduating from Trinity University in San Antonio, a respected private institution but not one of the Ivy League-level names he was in the habit of mentioning to his top clients.
[How honest college applicants are awaiting admissions results.]
As a college student and competitive baseball and basketball player in 1985, he mused to the universitys student newspaper, The Trinitonian, that he might like to work with young people someday. I like to communicate with people, and Im definitely a person who works hard on my own skills, he said.
In the article, he was pictured in his basketball jersey, the Trinity Tigers No. 25. I dont like to lose, he told the paper.
In the years that followed, Mr. Singer dabbled in a series of jobs and companies that he created, but always returned to counseling people for college.
The parents who hired him early on, in Sacramento, said they were thrilled by his confident, exacting approach. He swept into presentations, polished, authoritative and willing to drop names of renowned schools and clients from the top rungs of industry. He conveyed a calm certainty about the mysteries of the stress-inducing admissions system.
Janis Heaphy Durham, a former publisher of The Sacramento Bee, said that she enlisted Mr. Singer in late 2006 or early 2007, when he was well known among parents around town.
We hired him to keep Tanner on track, she said of her son.
Although her sons grades in high school were in order and he was being scouted by at least two universities as a rugby recruit, Ms. Durham recalled that Mr. Singer helped us navigate the application process, which can be daunting, and he had a good understanding of the personalities of the various schools. She would sometimes come home and find Mr. Singer sitting at her dining room table, working with her son on his homework.
But other people who encountered Mr. Singer at the time  particularly professional peers and counseling competitors  viewed him with suspicion. Some said he seemed to be promising things he couldnt necessarily deliver. Others chafed at his aggressive approach.
Jill Newman, a longtime counselor at schools in Sacramento, said that in meetings at Rio Americano High School, where she was working, Mr. Singer would forcefully advocate for students whose parents had retained him.
He would just come in and be very demanding, and say, We want this kid transferred to this teacher, and how do we make this happen, she recalled. He clearly schooled the families on how to behave. Parents would say things like, Rick told us to do this.
Ms. Amott eventually got into the business herself. She concluded that Mr. Singer didnt know much about what he was doing. She also questioned his ethics.
It drove me nuts that he would say that he could get you into X college, because an ethical consultant cannot make promises like that, since there are no guarantees, she said.
Around 2011, Mr. Singers life had reached a turning point.
His marriage had officially ended that year, according to court records. But his business was flourishing, as he continued to travel frequently and search out more clients. He appeared to be moving on from Sacramento and establishing a new home base in glitzier Southern California: In May 2012, Mr. Singer bought a house in Newport Beach for $1.55 million, according to property records, getting a mortgage for most of it.
Bill Townsend, an entrepreneur, met Mr. Singer around 2010 through a mutual friend, and was enlisted to build a new website for Mr. Singer, one that would more effectively tell the story of his growing business.
Mr. Singer spoke of his increasingly high-profile clientele, Mr. Townsend said. As I recall, a lot of tech contacts, media contacts, politicians, he said. It was an expensive service. Back then, it was about $12,000 or $15,000 a year.
It was around 2011, prosecutors said, that Mr. Singer began committing the crimes that were detailed in documents last week, soliciting bribes from parents to facilitate their childrens admissions to college  something he called a side door entrance to the entire college competition. Under his theory, the front door was for ordinary, law-abiding students applying the normal way and hoping for the best, and the back door was for families who made large donations to schools in the hope of boosting a students chances for admission there, a practice that is legal but not certain to succeed.
[Learn more about how families who have legally hired college admissions consultants view the ethics of their choices.]
Until the operation was interrupted by the F.B.I. eight years later, Mr. Singer promoted his side-door method, including faked athletic credentials and cheating on tests, as something the other methods were not: a sure thing.
He recruited coaches to his plan by telling them that plenty of other coaches were already involved, and that he had handled plenty of student applications this way. You can tell them I did 760 of these this year, he told a coach last year.
And to parents, he conveyed the same sort of certainty and swagger about his side-door method that he had shown for decades about standard college admissions coaching. Could cheating on a standardized test get a family in trouble? I have never seen it happen, Mr. Singer assured the father who asked.
Explaining the heart of his plans in a call last year that was secretly recorded by investigators, Mr. Singer told one parent: Theres lots of ways to do this. I can do anything and everything, if you guys are amenable to doing it.
Even as he talked to families in Southern California, Massachusetts and Illinois, Mr. Singer was aiming to expand his reputation nationally.
In YouTube videos, Mr. Singer gave tips on college admissions aimed at students and parents  and promoted his company, the Edge College & Career Network, called The Key. At least once, he made passing mention of his son, Bradley, saying that as a father, he understood how stressful the college-admissions process could be.
In 2012, Mr. Singer stepped more deeply into criminal activity, prosecutors said, by setting up the Key Worldwide Foundation, the charity that was used to disguise the true nature of payments from parents.
It was ostensibly established to provide a gateway to higher education for disadvantaged students, but it made financial donations to colleges and universities that were the top choices of Mr. Singers more affluent clients.
The foundations tax returns show that it received more than $7 million in contributions from 2013 through 2016, and that it listed around $2.7 million in donations that it distributed in the same period, mostly to universities. It is unclear whether the donation figures listed in the tax returns are accurate, since the foundation has been implicated as a major tool in the scheme.
Through his foundation, Mr. Singer donated $150,000 to DePaul University in Chicago while his son was an undergraduate there, said Carol Hughes, a spokeswoman for the college, noting that the younger Mr. Singer graduated in 2017. The donations, she said, were intended to support students as they studied abroad.
Between 2011 and 2018, parents paid Mr. Singer some $25 million to get their children into the right schools, prosecutors said.
By the end, as investigators were learning of the scheme, Mr. Singer seemed to have his illegal methods well established. He had grown bold about his side door, even cocky.
When he sought out photos of a student that he planned to insert digitally into a real image of an athlete, he breezily told one parent not to worry, he had done this a million times. In communications with colleges, he laid out false athletic credentials for students that might easily have been checked and revealed as lies; he listed one high school student as a 3-year Varsity Letter winner in water polo and Team M.V.P. 2017, even though the girl did not know how to play the sport.
Last summer, when an adviser at the University of Southern California asked an incoming freshman about his plans for the track team, the student  unaware that his parents and Mr. Singer had sold him as a track standout, complete with a pole-vaulting photo  phoned home, clearly confused. The students worried mother then called Mr. Singer, who brushed it all off. I would just go about your business and let it be, he told her.
When investigators stepped in last year, and confronted Mr. Singer with his years of questionable dealings, he turned on some of the families who had poured out their deepest parenting fears and trusted him with their complicated family dynamics.
In phone conversations that Mr. Singer knew were being recorded by the F.B.I., he prodded parents to acknowledge their part in shared crimes. If a parent sensed a problem and suggested meeting in person, Mr. Singer agreed  and then wore a wire.
Even then, he did not fully commit to cooperating with the government, the records show. Mr. Singer had built his business on relationships, recommendations and trust, and he appeared unwilling to tear all of it down again. At one point last year, the authorities say, Mr. Singer secretly reached out to several people involved in the plot  people he had presumably once sold on his know-how, his power, and himself  and warned them about the criminal investigation.

MELBOURNE  England coach Eddie Jones has ruled himself out of replacing Australia boss Michael Cheika after the Rugby World Cup, saying the Wallabies need a "generational change" in culture, local media reported on Friday.
Jones, who guided the Wallabies to the 2003 World Cup final before his acrimonious departure two years later, is reported to be on Rugby Australia's (RA) short-list of candidates.
Cheika has said he would quit if Australia failed to win the Sept. 20-Nov. 2 World Cup in Japan.
"I am happy in Europe," Jones told the Sydney Morning Herald.
"The Wallabies need a generational change in culture."
Australia, ranked sixth in the world, won only four of 13 tests in 2018, their worst season in decades.
Jones is contracted to England until 2021 but his deal features a break clause if the team flops in Japan.
Jones's comments come two weeks after New Zealander Dave Rennie said he was unlikely to take over the Australia job while contracted to Glasgow Warriors until 2020.
New Zealander Warren Gatland, the Wales and British and Irish Lions coach, has also been reported to be on RA's short-list.
Gatland is leaving Wales after the World Cup and has also been linked with taking over at defending champions New Zealand once Steve Hansen leaves the role after Japan.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA.
Sometimes. We. Cannot. Be. With. Our. Bodies.
Through July 7

Vanessa German, who makes her home and art in Pittsburgh now, says she created this immersive two-gallery sound, sculpture and text installation as a reaction to the deaths  and often unsolved murders  of African-American women and girls. Some figures in this work have no heads; some heads have no bodies; some hands are balled into fists; and found objects are everywhere. I think of it, she has said, as an act of restorative justice. Fralin Museum of Art at the University of Virginia, 155 Rugby Road, 434-924-3592,uvafralinartmuseum.virginia.edu/
DALLAS
Hands and Earth: Contemporary Japanese Ceramics
Through Jan. 5

The organizers describe this shows theme as avant-garde approaches to clay over the last 80 years. Of the 35 or so artists represented here, most are living and still creating art, but their works mirror artistic traditions millenniums old. Crow Museum of Asian Art, 2010 Flora Street, 214-979-6430,crowcollection.org
HOUSTON
Epidemic! Presents: Step and Screw: Trenton Doyle Hancock

A series of 30 works on paper. Mr. Hancock, who grew up in Paris, Tex., in the 1980s, makes a statement about racial injustice with his combination of comic book formatting and historical inscriptions. And the whole thing  featuring Torpedo Boy, Mr. Hancocks alter ego, and an invasion of hooded Ku Klux Klansmen  is installed in a shed with one lone light bulb in the center of the gallery. Menil Collection, 1533 Sul Ross Street, 713-525-9400,menil.org
NASHVILLE
Van Gogh, Monet, Degas and Their Times: The Mellon Collection of French Art

VERO BEACH, FLA.
Victorian Radicals: From the Pre-Raphaelites to the Arts & Crafts Movement
Through May 5

Not everyone in 19th-century England was in love with the changing world brought on by the Industrial Revolution. Some artists rejected change by turning back to medieval Europe for inspiration. This expansive show offers 145 paintings, drawings, sculptures and other works from rebels including Dante Gabriel Rossetti, John Everett Millais and William Morris. Vero Beach Museum of Art, 3001 Riverside Park Drive, 772-231-0707,vbmuseum.org

LOS ANGELES
Antarctic Dinosaurs
April 3-Jan. 5, 2020

The first thing you need to know: During the Triassic Period, Antarctica was not covered with glaciers, so its safe to say that these ancient creatures were not swathed in fur. This show, which recreates an expedition, includes a fossil skull of a newly discovered sauropodomorph (your children know that they were tall vegetarians and ate from the tops of trees). Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, 900 Exposition Boulevard, 213-763-3466,nhm.org
SAN FRANCISCO
Kimono Refashioned
Through May 5

You can find Japanese kimonos in art at least as far back as A.D. 800. This exhibition, with more than 35 garments from the Kyoto Costume Institute, shows how fashion designers around the world have  much more recently  borrowed from and adapted the kimonos fabrics, silhouettes and decorative motifs. One of the oldest pieces is a bustle gown made in London in the 1870s. Visitors can compare it with a 1910 British evening dress of cut velvet, twill and organdy; a 1995 Yohji Yamamoto dress with a black bodice and red and gold brocade skirt; a 1991 strapless black silk taffeta Commes des Garçons Noir dress with a hand-painted skirt; and kimono-influenced designs from Alexander McQueen and Tom Ford. Asian Art Museum, 200 Larkin Street, 415-581-3500,asianart.org

This is the first major retrospective for Mr. Girard, a hero in Santa Fe who died in 1993 and has his own wing here. There are textiles, furniture, sculpture, sketches, drawings and collages showing, as the museum says, a passion for colors, ornamentation and inspirations from folk art. Mr. Girard hated object labels and refused them in his wing, but this show does have normal labels. Organized by the Vitra Design Museum of Weil am Rhein, Germany. Museum of International Folk Art, 706 Camino Lejo (Museum Hill), 505-476-1200,internationalfolkart.org
SEATTLE
Jeffrey Gibson: Like a Hammer

STANFORD, CALIF.
Josiah McElheny: Island Universe
Through Aug. 18

Whats physics got to do with it?Mr. McElhenysinstallation  chromed metal, handblown glass and lights  uses precise mathematical calculations to comment on various theories of the universe, including the Big Bang theory and the multiverse concept. If the five hanging chandeliers remind you of the Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center in Manhattan, thats not an accident. The artist had a special consultant on this project: an astronomy professor. Cantor Arts Center, 328 Lomita Drive (at Museum Way), 650-498-1480,museum.stanford.edu

BOSTON
Botticelli: Heroines and Heroes
Through May 19

There you are, enjoying life in Renaissance Florence and redecorating your home. Because you can afford a Botticellispalliera a horizontal piece of art on paneling thats all the rage  you buy it and hang it above a bench or use it as a bed headboard. The Story of Lucretia and The Story of Virginia (both tempera, circa 1500) are the centerpieces here, and their statements are artistic and, in a disturbing new way, political. Its as though someone has finally turned on the lights about centuries-old misogynist messages, the Boston Globe review suggested when the show opened on Feb. 14. Women are being raped and murdered, and societys somehow the better for it. Karl Stevens, a 21st-century graphic novelist, has done cartoon versions of the two works, but from the womens point of view and with text.

Stonewall 50 at New-York Historical Society
May 24-Sept. 22

In June 1969, when police officers raided the Stonewall Inn, a Greenwich Village gay bar, something unexpected happened. The bar patrons, including more than a few drag queens, fought back, and the modern gay rights movement was born. This is a three-part 50th-anniversary commemoration, with the exhibitions Letting Loose and Fighting Back: LGBTQ Nightlife Before and After Stonewall; By the Force of Our Presence: Highlights From the Lesbian Herstory Archives; and a new installation, Say It Loud, Out and Proud, with images from a half century of gay pride marches.

T. Rex: The Ultimate Predator
Through Aug. 9, 2020

For a long time, this Upper West Side museum has been a special place to look at dinosaurs. Now, for the next year and a half, it also has a show celebrating the scariest of them all. If you had met a typical Tyrannosaurus rex (maybe in Montana or the Dakotas), it would have been at least 40 feet long and 12 feet tall (imagine two city buses on top of each other) with teeth so sharp they could bite through bones. This show offers models, fossils, casts and some virtual reality experiences, so visitors can pretend they live in the Cretaceous period.

Sara Bermans Closet: A Small and Monumental Story
April 5-Sept. 1

When Sara Berman was 60 and living in Israel  far from her Belarus birthplace  she left her husband and moved into a studio apartment in Greenwich Village. She also decided to start wearing only white. This tribute, a re-creation of her clothes closet and more, is from her daughter, the artist Maira Kalman, and her grandson, Alex Kalman, who say peoples everyday belongings convey major messages. The closet will be displayed outdoors on Kimmel Plaza. Inside, in the fifth-floor gallery, a show of paintings, texts and ephemera will look at Bermans life journey. She died in 2004.

Gorham Silver: Designing Brilliance: 1850-1970
May 3-Dec. 1

Are forks, knives and soup spoons works of art? The subject here isGorham silver, made in Providence since the 1830s and used in dining rooms, including Mary Todd Lincolns in the White House. But the show is much more than table settings. It includes 19th-century water pitchers, tureens, ice bowls, nutcrackers, fruit stands and epergnes (centerpieces), and 19th- and 20th-century tea and coffee services. Some individual utensils are standouts, too, like the 1879 unicorn-head egg spoon, the 19th-century souvenir teaspoon topped by a silver whaling ship and the 1893 bonbon spoon accented with enamel the colors of peacock feathers.

Manet and Modern Beauty
May 26-Sept. 8

In the late 1870s and early 1880s, whenÉdouard Manetwas in his later years (he was 51 when he died in 1883), he suddenly turned from painting historical and heroical art to creating studies of contemporary female beauty, often in watercolors and pastels. He had begun a four-season series, and two of this exhibitions standouts are the two completed portraits: Autumn (Méry Levant), showing her in a dark brown fur; and Jeanne (Spring), showing Jeanne Demarsy, an actress, in a light floral print, holding a parasol. Bonus: Rarely seen letters of Manets featuring his drawings. This is the museums first all-Manet show in more than half a century.

Prehistory
May 8-Sept. 16

Inspired by something as primitive as prehistoric sculpture? It was good enough for Picasso, Cézanne, Giacometti and many others. This show places art from the last century or so right next to Paleolithic and Neolithic works. Centre Pompidou, Place Georges Pompidou, 011-33-1-44-78-12-33,centrepompidou.fr
An earlier version of this article misstated the date on which the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, Fla., reopened after a major expansion. It was Feb. 9, not 19. The article also misstated the collective name for a commemoration at the New-York Historical Society. It is Stonewall 50 at New-York Historical Society, not Stonewall 50. A New-York Historical Society exhibition was also misidentified. It is By the Force of Our Presence: Highlights From the Lesbian Herstory Archives, not By the Force of Our Presence: Highlights From the Lesbian Herstory. It also misstated the conditions under which the subject of Sara Bermans Closet left her husband and then decided to start wearing only white. She was 60 and living in Israel, not 40 and living in New York.

PAID FOR AND POSTED BYSCOTLAND IS NOW
It may be a small country, with just over 5 million people, but Scotland has long had an outsized influence on the world. A pioneer in engineering, science and manufacturing, it is today poised for global leadership in modern industries rooted in innovation. And with a progressive spirit based in its rich history, tradition is constantly being reinvented.
In fact, Scotland was among the fastest-growing regions of the U.K. in 2018, with the country attracting more foreign investors than any other U.K. region outside London. While sectors like digital technology are set for strong growth, traditional industries also continue to thrive, with the tourism sector contributing £6 billion to the economy each year.*
Here, we speak to four people who each present a unique, thoroughly modern face of Scotland. From quality of life and the abundance of natural beauty to its entrepreneurial zeal and thirst for innovation, see how the country is providing consistent inspiration for their work and life.
*Source:Tourism and events, Scottish government
In Scotland, a laird means a landowner, or the lord of the manor. It has been passed down directly in my family, and I'm the 21st Lady of Traquair. What is really quite unique and extraordinary here is that it has lasted for 21 generations.
Can you tell us more about how you became a lady laird and what that entails?
Traquair is Scotland's oldest continuously lived-in house, and it dates back over 900 years. It's also been lived in by the same family, which was the Stuarts, since 1491. When it fell into the hands of the Earl of Buchan, he gave it to his son, James Stuart, who became the first laird in 1491. In Scotland, a laird means a landowner, or the lord of the manor. It has been passed down directly in my family, and I'm the 21st Lady of Traquair. What is really quite unique and extraordinary here is that it has lasted for 21 generations.
Some rooms of the house are now available to book, and you also have a small brewery. How did these more entrepreneurial-driven ventures come to life?
Postwar, the condition of the house was pretty poor. There was a great question mark over whether my parents were going to be able to maintain it and survive. They began exploring how they could open the house to the public, how they could make the whole venture work. A lot of the real innovation, I think, came at that time in the 1960s. It was my father who basically opened a little door into an outbuilding and realized there was a brewhouse there, ready to go! He started brewing in the mid-'60s, which really was ahead of its time. There were no microbreweries out there at all.
Youve also added a list of events throughout the year. What was your reasoning behind those?
My background is in arts administration. I worked for theater companies, and that was my interest when I came back. One of the first things I did was to create an annual program of events here. We now have a big medieval fair. We organize things around Easter, too. For instance, we came up with the idea of an Easter egg hunt in the maze, where we planted 6,000 mini eggs. Our Beyond Borders International Festival is returning for its 10th edition, with broadcasters, writers, artists and politicians exchanging ideas about some of the most pressing issues of our time.
How important is it for you to bring the rich history of the place  and the area as a whole  to younger generations?
I was 25 when I took over. I was young. I wanted to do things that were vibrant and kept the house alive. We've always been a very small family-run business. Now I'm looking to do less commercial projects, but which are all about making the house and the estate as accessible as possible to the local community. I want to do a lot more community-involved projects.
How do you find a balance between preserving the richness of the place and its history while also making it attractive to visitors?
There are different audiences for different events. Our day-to-day visitors who come and see the house are probably still the largest market. I think we are quite lucky that we have a lot of lovely grounds. We also have things like a secret escape in the house and the maze in the back. It's a fun house for children, and we can engage children quite well here. In fact, I think most historic houses, if they really look, can engage the young audience into experiencing history.
What are your recommendation of unique, must-see places that are not necessarily on everybody's map?
I think that following the course of the famous River Tweed is a lovely thing to do, because it takes you through the amazing Tweed Valley. You can hike, cycle or mountain bike. As you go further down the river, you discover places like Melrose, which is an absolute jewel, and Melrose Abbey, which has got the most extraordinary history, and where Robert the Bruce's heart is meant to be buried. Then, further down, Dryburgh Abbey, which is not so well visited but is a really beautiful ruin. Some of the abbey ruins are really spectacular. Then there's a very quirky statue, which I discovered not that long ago, a staggering 20-foot-high statue of William Wallace looking over the Borders!
What are the things that visitors find more surprising about Scotland and the Borders?
I think they are taken by the fact that it touches history. You are really coming to a bit of living history. It's real, authentic. Scotland has got so much in terms of that culture behind it. What you see, the big iconic shots, is really just the beginning of what is behind that. There's so much of Scotland to be explored.
One of the things about Scotland is that its pretty small, so between Edinburgh and Glasgow, youre only talking around 40 miles. With this, you get that clustering effect, which is important when youre building something new.
Could you explain how Renovite Technologies cloud native payment solutions work?
We provide infrastructure that allows banks to handle transactions from consumers. Think about when you make a debit or credit card purchase in a store or online, or withdraw cash from an ATM. Our systems collect those transactions when you conduct them, transport them securely through banks networks and then back to the issuing organization so that authorization can take place.
What makes Renovite Technologies products different from other, similar services?
Were unique because we have built this system to operate in the cloud from the beginning. Most payment infrastructures today are built on software products that date back to the 1980s and 1990s. They were designed in a world when the internet didnt exist  never mind mobile commerce.
Renovite Technologies global headquarters is in California, yet it decided to open its U.K. base in Fife. Why?
We made a strategic decision to work in Scotland, and in Fife specifically, because historically its the center of ATM software development. The real center is actually Dundee, which is just north of Fife. A lot of big software companies here created a cluster, which is important when youre building something new and trying to be innovative  you need ideas to feed off.
How do you feel about the quality of life in Scotland?
Theres definitely a quality-of-life aspect to living here. Also, I was confident that I could recruit experienced, skilled individuals if I opened an office here. Because of the great quality of life, lots of people who Ive been recruiting have stayed for a long time.
Do you feel Scotland is a good place for innovation?
One of the things about Scotland is that its pretty small, so between Edinburgh and Glasgow, youre only talking around 40 miles. With this, you get that clustering effect, which is important when youre building something new. Because these big cities in Scotland are close together, people can move around, gain experience and join new companies without having huge disruptions of moving long distances or having very long commutes.
Does the Scottish government make doing business here easier?
Scotland obviously has its own devolved government, so it can take action to encourage businesses to develop. And weve benefited from that ourselves, in terms of government funding and helping us create jobs. While other parts of the U.K. have regional development agencies, the central government is pretty much focused on London.
We decided to build a distillery in the Scottish Borders because there hadnt been one for 180 years.
You launched your business with three friends in 2013. Why here, and why whisky?
We decided to build a distillery in the Scottish Borders because there hadnt been one for 180 years, and we thought that being number one in the Borders would be better than being number 70 in Speyside. We bought and renovated an old building. We wanted to reflect in the project Scotland's industrial heritage, its history of making things, and we decided right at the outset that we would exceed the environmental targets, agreed between the whisky industry and the Scottish government, established for the industry.
This commitment to environmental standards is very important for you. How did you apply them throughout the building?
Well, there are two contexts: one is regulation  governments want businesses like ours to behave as well as they can. They don't want us to pass on the costs of our industries to the public and to the wider consumer, and that's one motivation. The other is that when you make whisky, you're only selling it 10 or 12 years after you've made it. So we're making whisky for the next half generation. By being as thoughtful in design and expenditure as we possibly can, we've built something at the highest environmental standard, and that will sustain us as we start to sell to the next generation of consumers.
What role does your location and natural environment play in what you do?
You're only allowed to make whisky from three things: barley, water and yeast. The Scottish Borders are the center of barley growing for Scotland. We're in the Tweed Valley, and there is a fantastic water table underneath the town, which is why the industry came here in the first place in the 17th century. We're exploiting that industrial heritage and generational knowledge of how to work within the natural environment, and our use of water replicates exactly what a mill owner in the 1770s would have understood to be how you use water.
Youve incorporated modern technologies throughout the building. How do you find the perfect balance between high tech and being mindful of the heritage of the craft itself?
In Scotch whisky, all we're doing is distilling a fermented product. Thats been going on for 5,000 or 6,000 years, as far as we know. We are also confined by a set of regulations: Only three ingredients that have been in oak for three years can be called single malt Scotch whisky. So we're not doing anything new. Where we can innovate and where we can improve over time is using new technology on energy consumption: use of light, use of design, training of people, sustainable sourcing. These are all areas which improve our competitiveness and business, but it's also the right thing to do. It's what the society wants today and what the future consumer wants  and the future consumer will demand this behavior.
You're quite connected with the local community. Could you tell us more about this?
When you build the distillery right in the middle of somebody else's town, you're going to have neighbors. We wanted to be supportive of the community. We can support rugby; we can support art; we can support other activities. When a new business comes into a town like that, you don't try and grab everything for yourself. Therefore, we didnt open a café in the distillery, nor a restaurant, but five of six have opened around here since we've arrived. Its an ecosystem, with a business multiplier effect, and that is good for the community.
Thinking of heritage crafts similar to yours, are there other traditional industries in the area that are going through a similar revival?
The textile industry [the Tweed Valley is home to the famous Scottish tweed] has gone through wrenching change in Hawick in the last 40 years, but it's coming out the other side now. There are way fewer firms, but those who are left are operating at a level where we can compete. This is where the skills are, and people are here. So this is why the business is here.
[Scotland] has a proud tradition of innovation and is home to numerous inventions that have changed the world. This tradition continues in the business community today, with a rich entrepreneurial ecosystem.
Do you find Scotland to be welcoming toward innovation and entrepreneurialism?
As a financial hub, Id say in the U.K., Scotland is probably the most established outside of London. The key thing for me in Scotland has been that the country has a culture of innovation thats been longstanding. It has a proud tradition of innovation and is home to numerous inventions that have changed the world. This tradition continues in the business community today, with a rich entrepreneurial ecosystem.
And how does this innovation manifest itself at Barclays in Scotland?
Weve committed heavily to innovation and entrepreneurialism through various initiatives and strategic partnerships. For example, our first Scottish Eagle Lab [a space for businesses and communities to learn about new technologies] opened in Edinburgh in 2018, in partnership with the tech incubator CodeBase. This tech-infused space has cutting-edge equipment for digital fabrication, 3-D printing and laser cutting, providing businesses with access to the tools they need to rapidly produce and test prototypes without having to import them from overseas.
Youre also overseeing the opening of Barclays new, state-of-the-art campus in Glasgow. What is it?
The Glasgow campus is a key part of Barclays global plan to build dynamic, world-class environments in some of our largest sites for investment and growth. Its a state-of-the-art, campuslike workspace, including three buildings which will provide colleagues with a lifestyle that links to their needs. The site will have local shops, hair salons, barbers and also an herb garden. By building this campus, well double our headcount from 2,500 to 5,000 and become the largest financial services employer in Scotland through this growth.
And how will this new site affect Glasgow as a whole?
There are a couple of things  obviously, the generation of 2,500, medium-to-high-income jobs, for one. Secondly, its the regeneration of a part of the city that currently doesnt have office space and is part of a larger regeneration of our River Clyde, the waterfront. Thirdly, with these 5,000 colleagues, we have the ability to help citizenship environments through philanthropy. We have specific targets about hiring individuals who come from a background thats not relevant to working in a bank, whether theyre over a certain age or are disabled. We genuinely want to improve this environment as well as hiring other people that work in other banks already.
How has the Scottish government helped foster the local economy and the finance sector?
Over the last 30 years, weve gone from an office of 40 people to now 2,500. And with our new development, well go to 5,000. That growth has absolutely been done in conjunction with the Scottish government. Its a critical part. For example, the Scottish government delivered a training program called CodeClan, which gives individuals specific coding training. It provides candidates with a 10-week course so they can become very technically gifted in this area thats not relevant to businesses  not just for Barclays, but across the board.
Do you think Scotland is an attractive place to live and work in? If so, why?
The cost of living and quality of life are absolutely critical. Its a conscious part of peoples decision-making process. You can be on a one-hour flight from London to Glasgow, and youre just 20 minutes from the airport to sitting at your desk. So accessibility is critical. Also, the cost of living is significantly cheaper, and theres a quality of life, with all the options people have here in terms of a tourist perspective. We have two senior hires who are moving from London to Scotland because of the quality of life here.

SYDNEY  Lloyd McDermott, one of the first indigenous Australians to play for the Wallabies and the nation's first Aboriginal barrister, has died aged 79, Rugby Australia said on Sunday.
A pacy winger, McDermott won two caps against New Zealand in 1962 but refused to tour apartheid South Africa the following year as an "honorary white" and switched codes to rugby league.
Along with his career in the law, McDermott worked throughout his life to encourage indigenous youth to play rugby union, in later years through his eponymous development team the "Lloydies".
"His legacy is not just his work in promoting sport to young people it is also about equality in opportunities for young people," said Gary Ella, who now runs the team.
"The ... team's objectives are based on Lloyds leadership of creating education and opportunities for young people and supporting them to make positive lifestyle decisions.
"Lloyd's work has positively influenced thousands of young Indigenous people around Australia."A proud but humble man, he refused to accept Australia Day honours on several occasions until the rights of Aboriginal people were recognised. We will miss a close friend and we are inspired to continue our work."
The three Ella brothers, Gary, Mark and Glenn, all played for Australia and make up a fifth of the indigenous Wallabies in over 120 years of test rugby for the nation.
Cecil Ramalli, the son of an Indian father and Aboriginal mother who played two tests in 1938, is widely acknowledged as the first Wallaby of indigenous heritage.

Less than a month after theNew England Patriots won the Super Bowl, a group of Massachusetts lawmakers has proposed a bill that would ban organized youth tackle football until after seventh grade.
The bill, which moved to the Massachusetts legislaturesJoint Committee on Public Healththis week, follows unsuccessful attempts by legislators in five other states to pass similar measures to protect growing brains from traumatic injury.
The bipartisan bill, known asNo Hits, would impose financial penalties for any school league or other entity that does not comply.
There is significant science detailing repetitive head impacts have long-term neurological consequences, especially when they occur during brain development, one of the bills sponsors, Representative Paul A. Schmid III, a Democrat, said in a statement.
Although some medical professionals and former N.F.L. players have signaled their support for the measure andpublic opinion could buoy its prospects, the bill is already facing headwinds.
Two representatives who initially supported the measure have withdrawn their names from the bill, and a few other legislators said they would not support it.
Should we ban youth soccer too? asked Representative David Nangle, a Democrat who opposes the bill. Or youth hockey? When do we stop legislating into areas that we shouldnt be?
A spokeswoman for U.S.A. Football, whichgoverns youth football, said in a statement that the organization believes that decisions on allowing children to play football are best left to parents. To that end, she said, it has createda set of guidelinesdeveloped by leaders in athlete development and football.
The executive director of Pop Warner, Jon Butler, said in a statement that the organization had worked to improve player safety by eliminating the three-point stance and removing kickoffs for younger athletes. Banning football is not the answer, but we do agree that we should continue our efforts to make the game safer for our kids, he said.
Studiesby Boston Universityand other research centers have shown that children who began playing tackle football before the age of 12 were at greater risk for cognitive, mood and behavioral issues later in life, as well as conditions like chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.
But there has been opposition to those findings from the N.F.L. and even from well-intentioned parents, said Michael Kaplen, a lawyer whoteaches a legal course on traumatic brain injuryandtracks legislation governing youth tackle football. Mr. Kaplen said that there was no such thing as safer tackling and that a youth leagues promoting safer tackling would be similar to big tobacco companies offering low-nicotine cigarettes.
People dont understand that even a minor blow to the head has risks, he said. It may take years for these problems to become unmasked.
Steve Dembowski, 49, an executive board member of theMassachusetts High School Football Coaches Association, said parents, rather than the state, should be able to make choices for their children.
Considering that kids at that age get concussions playing soccer and baseball and any other sport where they can fall and hit their head on the ground, he said, it seems like an overstep of authority.
Damon Stanton, 43, has two sons who play football, and he coachesyouth football in Hanson, Mass., about 25 miles south of Boston.
I understand the concern, he said, citing the Boston University study. But he said more attention should be paid to the work that is being done to make the sport safer since the knuckle-dragging days when you would hit hit hit, and run until you were puking during practice.
He said his team had invested in new equipment, like foam tires that minimize player contact during practices, and introducedshoulder-tackling techniques developed byU.S.A. Football.
Mr. Stanton acknowledged that he might not be as influential as the Patriots head coach, Bill Belichick, adding that he is not a political guy.
But, he said, Ill definitely be calling my rep to let him know how I feel.
In recent years, tackle football has lost some of its luster among middle and high schoolers, and their parents. In 2017, about 2.4 million athletes from ages 6 to 17 regularly played the sport, down slightly from the year before, according tothe Sports & Fitness Industry Association. Rugby is gaining popularity because its tackling techniques appear less risky, whichincreasingly appeals to coaches who are leery of concussions.
There have been moves in some parts of the country to further address player safety for tackle football at the high school level. This month, the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Associationadopted new guidelinesintended to sharply reduce the amount of contact allowed during high school practices.
But several efforts last year to pass statewide legislation governing youth leagues werequashed by grass-roots movementsled by parents and coaches.
When Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle of New Jerseyproposed banning tackle football for children under 12, parents, coaches and players threatened to vote her out of office, she said in an email.
That bill is currently in limbo.
Unfortunately, the old boys club of politics and football go hand in hand, said Ms. Huttle, a Democrat. This bill has and will continue to receive pushback because it goes against the American grain.
A similar billin New York failed, and Californias Safe Football Act waspulled before a committee vote.The Dave Duerson Act, named after a Chicago Bears player who killed himself at age 50,did not make it past the Illinois legislature. And Marylands proposal, which also would have prohibited heading in soccer,was killed in committee.
These efforts, futile as they sometimes prove to be, still have a positive effect, supporters say.
I really did not expect it to pass, said Delegate Terri Hill, the Democratic legislator who sponsored Marylands bill.
But I think its a conversation we have to have, she said, and I dont think the conversation is over.
Representative Bradley H. Jones, a Republican who is a sponsor of the Massachusetts bill, echoed Ms. Hill.
Some football programs have already made changes indicating that there is at least some recognition of this problem, he said. If this bill does nothing else, I am hopeful that it starts a dialogue that will lead to the implementation of best practices and standards across the board to protect kids from long-term brain injuries.

TOULOUSE, France  Former France coach Guy Noves is entitled to one million euros (£862,415) in compensation for wrongful dismissal by the national rugby federation, a French court said on Monday.
The FFR alleged Noves was guilty of serious misconduct, but a Toulouse labour tribunal decided otherwise. Noves was asking for 2.88 million euros.
Both parties have the right to appeal, although initial reactions suggested that they had accepted the outcome.
"I am satisfied with this decision. The FFR said there was serious misconduct and the tribunal said there was none," Noves, the first France rugby union coach to be sacked, told reporters.
"I don't know if we are going to appeal, we have a month to do so. The demands (from Noves) were excessive and the decision is reasonable," the FFR's lawyer Joseph Aguera told French sports newspaper L'Equipe.
The FFR later welcomed a "balanced" decision and said in a statement it did not plan to appeal.
Noves was sacked by the FFR in December 2017 after winning seven of his 21 matches in charge, while his contract was due to run until the end of this year's World Cup in Japan.
Noves, 65, was replaced by Jacques Brunel, who has been struggling to turn the situation around.
France beat Scotland and Italy in this year's Six Nations but lost against England, Ireland and Wales to finish fourth.

Less than a month after theNew England Patriots won the Super Bowl, a group of Massachusetts lawmakers has proposed a bill that would ban organized youth tackle football until after seventh grade.
The bill, which moved to the Massachusetts legislaturesJoint Committee on Public Healththis week, follows unsuccessful attempts by legislators in five other states to pass similar measures to protect growing brains from traumatic injury.
The bipartisan bill, known asNo Hits, would impose financial penalties for any school league or other entity that does not comply.
There is significant science detailing repetitive head impacts have long-term neurological consequences, especially when they occur during brain development, one of the bills sponsors, Representative Paul A. Schmid III, a Democrat, said in a statement.
Although some medical professionals and former N.F.L. players have signaled their support for the measure andpublic opinion could buoy its prospects, the bill is already facing headwinds.
Two representatives who initially supported the measure have withdrawn their names from the bill, and a few other legislators said they would not support it.
Should we ban youth soccer too? asked Representative David Nangle, a Democrat who opposes the bill. Or youth hockey? When do we stop legislating into areas that we shouldnt be?
A spokeswoman for U.S.A. Football, whichgoverns youth football, said in a statement that the organization believes that decisions on allowing children to play football are best left to parents. To that end, she said, it has createda set of guidelinesdeveloped by leaders in athlete development and football.
The executive director of Pop Warner, Jon Butler, said in a statement that the organization had worked to improve player safety by eliminating the three-point stance and removing kickoffs for younger athletes. Banning football is not the answer, but we do agree that we should continue our efforts to make the game safer for our kids, he said.
Studiesby Boston Universityand other research centers have shown that children who began playing tackle football before the age of 12 were at greater risk for cognitive, mood and behavioral issues later in life, as well as conditions like chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.
But there has been opposition to those findings from the N.F.L. and even from well-intentioned parents, said Michael Kaplen, a lawyer whoteaches a legal course on traumatic brain injuryandtracks legislation governing youth tackle football. Mr. Kaplen said that there was no such thing as safer tackling and that a youth leagues promoting safer tackling would be similar to big tobacco companies offering low-nicotine cigarettes.
People dont understand that even a minor blow to the head has risks, he said. It may take years for these problems to become unmasked.
Steve Dembowski, 49, an executive board member of theMassachusetts High School Football Coaches Association, said parents, rather than the state, should be able to make choices for their children.
Considering that kids at that age get concussions playing soccer and baseball and any other sport where they can fall and hit their head on the ground, he said, it seems like an overstep of authority.
Damon Stanton, 43, has two sons who play football, and he coachesyouth football in Hanson, Mass., about 25 miles south of Boston.
I understand the concern, he said, citing the Boston University study. But he said more attention should be paid to the work that is being done to make the sport safer since the knuckle-dragging days when you would hit hit hit, and run until you were puking during practice.
He said his team had invested in new equipment, like foam tires that minimize player contact during practices, and introducedshoulder-tackling techniques developed byU.S.A. Football.
Mr. Stanton acknowledged that he might not be as influential as the Patriots head coach, Bill Belichick, adding that he is not a political guy.
But, he said, Ill definitely be calling my rep to let him know how I feel.
In recent years, tackle football has lost some of its luster among middle and high schoolers, and their parents. In 2017, about 2.4 million athletes from ages 6 to 17 regularly played the sport, down slightly from the year before, according tothe Sports & Fitness Industry Association. Rugby is gaining popularity because its tackling techniques appear less risky, whichincreasingly appeals to coaches who are leery of concussions.
There have been moves in some parts of the country to further address player safety for tackle football at the high school level. This month, the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Associationadopted new guidelinesintended to sharply reduce the amount of contact allowed during high school practices.
But several efforts last year to pass statewide legislation governing youth leagues werequashed by grass-roots movementsled by parents and coaches.
When Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle of New Jerseyproposed banning tackle football for children under 12, parents, coaches and players threatened to vote her out of office, she said in an email.
That bill is currently in limbo.
Unfortunately, the old boys club of politics and football go hand in hand, said Ms. Huttle, a Democrat. This bill has and will continue to receive pushback because it goes against the American grain.
A similar billin New York failed, and Californias Safe Football Act waspulled before a committee vote.The Dave Duerson Act, named after a Chicago Bears player who killed himself at age 50,did not make it past the Illinois legislature. And Marylands proposal, which also would have prohibited heading in soccer,was killed in committee.
These efforts, futile as they sometimes prove to be, still have a positive effect, supporters say.
I really did not expect it to pass, said Delegate Terri Hill, the Democratic legislator who sponsored Marylands bill.
But I think its a conversation we have to have, she said, and I dont think the conversation is over.
Representative Bradley H. Jones, a Republican who is a sponsor of the Massachusetts bill, echoed Ms. Hill.
Some football programs have already made changes indicating that there is at least some recognition of this problem, he said. If this bill does nothing else, I am hopeful that it starts a dialogue that will lead to the implementation of best practices and standards across the board to protect kids from long-term brain injuries.

LONDON  In the British capital, it is the calm before the storm. The countrys scheduled departure from the European Union  Brexit  is mere weeks away, although no deal has been reached. And so little is clear about what will become of Britain in the wake of its decision to Leave that many people seem resigned to the uncertainty of the moment. There is a tempest bearing down. But until then?
Until then, it is London Fashion Week, which wrapped up its biannual round on Tuesday.
Fashion is a multibillion-dollar industry in Britain, and a global one: It can neither afford to grind to a halt for Brexit nor afford to ignore it.
Theres nothing we can really do, Molly Goddard said after her show in answer to the inevitable questions. We have a lot of European partners but beyond that I dont really know. Ms. Goddards signature are many-tiered tulle dresses, candy-pink confections that can each require 200 feet or more of fabric  the lady as layer cake  but this season she showed them undergirded with trousers and boots beneath, and balaclavas above. Everything was meant to be stomped in, she said.
Like the Boy Scouts say: Be prepared. Ms. Goddard, whose dresses can look princess-y, has always understood that there is no inherent contradiction between sweetness and strength. Not for nothing is one of her most famous customers Villanelle, the deadly assassin in Killing Eve. (Never mind that Villanelles fictional.)

It is unfair to demand that designers reflect the politics of the moment in their work, and unfair to ask them to be spokespeople for the decisions of government ministers. Yet the question bubbled up again and again over the course of five days in London, in the backstage scrums where they faced the press and explained their work: Dont youhateBrexit? said a voice from the crowd that was facing down Riccardo Tisci, Burberrys chief creative officer, on Sunday under the hot, sharp glare of the lights at the Tate Modern following his second show for the brand.
I cannot answer, Mr. Tisci said. Everyone has a different opinion, of course.
But he had called his show Tempest. And he had just finished opining that we need the younger generation to be more free, and express themselves. He felt there had been greater freedom 20 years earlier, when he was studying at Central St. Martins. But two days before, London schoolchildren had skived off classes  Americans call it cutting, but the Britishism really captures the sense better to noisily protestinaction on climate change in the streets. It seemed Mr. Tisci was the less-free one, practicing the diplomatic parry of the corporate steward.

He has, after all, a behemoth to consider. Burberry aspires to be all things to all people, and Mr. Tisci ticked off the strength he felt the label deserves to have: not only fashion, but accessories, evening wear, streetwear, underwear, expensive clothes, affordable clothes. (All things being relative: Burberry T-shirts, like the one Mr. Tisci was wearing, can cost $390.)
To me, Burberry is lifestyle, he said. Its not a fashion label. It represents a lifestyle. And it represents a country.
With a remit that broad, it only makes sense that he based his collection on the idea of including, not excluding things. In the Tate, he divided his show space into two: one room, concrete, grimly lit, with chain-link fence; the other a kind of private theater with gleaming wood and cushioned seats. The tough and the posh.
He divided the collection along the same lines. There was a streetwear section of rugby shirts and puffers, trainers and track pants. Then came the bourgeois: the good old Burberry trench, fluty dresses, trailing scarves. (It would be nearly impossible to mistake one for the other, but if, say, you were viewing from space, the hair was the tell: gorgeous, elaborate curlicues more or less tattooed to the models foreheads for the street; sober, severe buns for the rest, snug in their own little nets.)
It had more sharpness and more bite thanMr. Tiscis first collection for Burberry, which was washed-out in a medley of dutiful beige. But it nevertheless had more of the attitudes of aggression (familiar to Mr. Tiscis fans from his years at Givenchy) than real snap. For all its enormous breadth, it felt more styled than meant, a tempest that would fit neatly in a teapot.
Mr. Tisci played with references of Cool Britannia, rave and chav (British for lout), and the vaunted DNA of Burberry  a word fashion executives love to use, in an eerily eugenic way. But the effort to be everything to everyone is enervating, and no doubt exhausting. Its no secret in the industry that lifestyle is the lifeblood of the business: Those that cant afford or cant wear luxury runway fashion have to be invited in with a T-shirt, a boxer brief, a perfume, a handbag, a keychain. But is that effort killing fashion?
Im sorry. Thats grouchy.
Its not Mr. Tiscis fault that fashion has grown so giant. Lifestyle is the general ambition.
It is clearly Victoria Beckhams. But then, shes already a lifestyle. Ms. Beckham is an icon in a truer sense of the word than is usually meant by the terms constant invocation  images of her are studied and revered  and she has built up a line offering women a way to dress like her.

This fall, after a trial run with Estée Lauder, she intends to introduce her own makeup collection. And at a preview at her studio in West London a few days before her show, she said that skin care will follow after that.
So when a bright red she called lipstick red rippled through the collection, you got what she was gesturing at. But it went down gently because Ms. Beckham delivered a collection, on a sunny Sunday morning at the Tate Britain, that was focused, appealing and, most importantly, real: suits and nipped-waist blazers, slouchy trousers and longish skirts, dresses and coats and muzzy knits that women could wear. Not only out but in: Into the office, into the lunch meeting, into the Tube.
We know my customer, Ms. Beckham said, and for a change, you believed it.

Fantasy predominates at fashion week, often fabulously so. When Joan Collins finally comes scampering into an Erdem show half an hour past its scheduled start gasping, I was stuck in the lift!, you pinch yourself. Is this a dream? When Christopher Kane designs a collection around balloon fetishists and latex kinksters, looners and rubberists, you pinch yourself  or worse. (Im not here to judge.)
But throughout London, the strongest impressions were made by clothes that seemed destined to go farther than the runway and Instagram, more life than lifestyle. No disrespect to the palliative power of fantasy but, with tempests on the horizon, the real way may be the wise way.
Away from the hamster wheel of hype are designers who have been working away steadily for decades, artists of the small detail and subtle tweak. Margaret Howell is one of those: After more than 40 years in business, she remains so discreet and so untroubled by the need for acclaim that you could spot her (if youcouldspot her) casually chatting, unrecognized, in the stairwell to her show space as dozens of guests there to see her show streamed obliviously past. But her collection was filled with pieces you would be glad to own, their proportions ever so slightly improved. Hussein Chalayan, who celebrateshis 25th anniversaryin business this year, is another: He has a wonderful way of reworking something you know  a white shirt, an unstructured blazer  into something recognizable but new, so you see it fresh.
Real women, real clothes. They were there at Simone Rocha, whose show was all the more affecting for its casting of models of different ages and different sizes, just as her real clients are. When Chloë Sevigny came ambling down the runway, smiling, it didnt feel like a stunt, any more than when Jeny Howorth or Jade Parfitt or Tess McMillan followed. Ms. Rochas collection has a place for them all.
And real clothes were at J.W. Anderson, who often strays into hinterlands of the esoteric. He didnt here, although he also didnt dull himself into normalcy either. Jonathan Anderson said he wanted to take the noise out and focus on clothing, and the collection was a reminder that he can: That behind the theatrics and the riddles that sometimes dog his efforts are often very good clothes. Here they were on dazzling display, in particular, his beautiful wrap coats and puddling trousers.

Its tempting to think of Mr. Anderson floating above it all, especially when he said that he had designed his set, with its little rocks poking out of cream-colored carpet to suggest mountaintops poking through the clouds  as if his models were sailing over the sky, safe from the storm. But this was a much more grounded collection for Mr. Anderson, and all the better for it.
Shows like that put me in a good mood, Sidney Toledano, the chairman and chief executive of the LVMH Fashion Group, a minority stakeholder in the brand, whispered to Mr. Anderson.
Little else at the moment may be clear but this: I felt the same.

If you were trapped in a room and you had to break down the door to get out, you wouldnt hit that door with your head, says Rex Norris, who runs football for Atavus, a Seattle-based tackling consultancy that has worked with youth, high school, college and professional teams on shoulder-led tackling. After more than a decade of crisis and controversy over concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., American football organizations are looking to other sports like rugby and wrestling for alternative, lower-risk sacking methods. Never go into a tackle intending to hit with your head. Keep your head and neck out of the equation, Norris says. Last year, even the National Football League began penalizing players for helmet-led contact.
Get close before you strike. Decide which shoulder you intend to hit the person with, and then keep the foot on that side planted on the ground  if youre slamming with your left shoulder, for example, put your weight into the ball of your left foot as you make contact. Your power comes from your legs and feet, Norris says. Aim low: Ideally, your shoulder should hit your opponents thigh area, but consider anywhere between the pectoral muscles and the knees fair game. Square your body toward your opponent and, as you move forward, keep your elbows tucked in and your hands up, like a boxers. Maintain momentum after contact.
Finding newfangled ways to knock other humans down to the ground is something of a growth industry. The technique is not skill-specific, and its not age-specific, Norris says; in 2018, Atavus began providing mandatory shoulder-led tackling certification to all 23,000 high school and junior high school football coaches in Texas. Leaving your head out of a tackle isnt just a mind game, though; you need to do drills until muscle memory takes over. Players usually take to it quickly, but coaches tend to be more calcified in their ways. A quote Norris heard somewhere often comes to mind: Some coaches love winning so much theyre willing to change, and some coaches hate change so bad theyre willing to lose.

ARLINGTON, Tex.  Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.
The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the states 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.
The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.
Its where to put your head that is the focus now, Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, Get your head out of it, he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.
From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.
After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.
That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was under attack, even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game  which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork  far outweighed its risks.
The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches awareness of concussions and all the things were trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training thats coming on board, said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.
Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.
Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.
Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.
Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted hawk tackling, which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, alsouses video to analyze and rate tacklesas well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.
In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear scrum caps but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.
Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:
We believe in tackling the legs, he told the coaches. We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.
Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing ones power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. Its not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control, he said.
Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted bygroups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.
But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example,U.S.A. Football walked back a studyit released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.
And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons  such as hitting their head on the turf  that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.
Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a more fine-grained analysis to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.
Still, he noted, just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense, he said. He also said that from his perspective, this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.
At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hours drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.
When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice, he said of the rugby-style technique. Its a win-win.
As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.
Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning topromote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.
Im not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesnt want her kids to play the game, said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. You can be as safe as you want to be, but its still a violent sport.

SYDNEY  Sydney FC's top of the table A-League clash against Perth Glory this month has been moved away from the Sydney Cricket Ground after a furore over the 'dangerous' pitch at the iconic stadium during the weekend.
Australia's players' union joined Melbourne Victory boss Kevin Muscat in slamming the SCG pitch after visiting midfielder Terry Antonis suffered a knee injury during a match against Sydney FC on Saturday night.
Head of Leagues Greg O'Rourke said that although the Football Federation Australia (FFA) considered the surface to be "playable and safe", the April 18 fixture would be moved to Jubilee Oval "in the best interests of all stakeholders".
"The SCG's (cricket) wicket block ... compromises the uniformity of the field for football in particular," he said in a joint statement with Sydney FC and the SCG.
Antonis fell to the ground untouched on the edge of the cricket square during a 2-1 loss for his side in a clash between the last two Australian champions.
Professional Footballers Australia (PFA) called for an independent investigation into how the match was allowed to go ahead given the 'deplorable state' of the pitch, which the body said posed a clear danger to player safety.
The SCG is being used by soccer, rugby league and rugby union teams in addition to hosting its usual cricket and Australian Rules matches while the neighbouring Sydney Football Stadium (SFS) is re-built.
Some 3,000 square metres of turf were relaid after the surface was torn up during a rugby union match last month.
Sydney FC travel to city rivals Western Sydney Wanderers next weekend but are assured of still being in second place behind Perth, who are six points clear at the top of the A-League, going into the match the following week.
"This is a hugely important fixture with first playing second and we want the narrative to be about the football," Sydney FC Chief Executive Danny Townsend said.
"This is a decision made in the viewing interest of members and supporters."
The SCG has hosted test cricket since 1882 and was the venue for hundreds of rugby league and union matches before the SFS was completed in 1988.

SYDNEY  Australia's players' union has joined Melbourne Victory boss Kevin Muscat in denouncing the "dangerous" Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) pitch after a player suffered a knee injury during an A-League match against Sydney FC on Saturday night.
Midfielder Terry Antonis fell to the ground untouched on the edge of the cricket square during a 2-1 loss for his side in a clash between the last two Australian champions.
The iconic ground is being used for football codes while the neighbouring Sydney Football Stadium is re-vamped and has already attracted criticism after it was torn up during a rugby match.
"It was dangerous, first and foremost," Muscat told reporters.
"To ask players to come and work under those conditions is unacceptable. It might be a serious injury as a result from it. And for players to go out onto that, whatever it's called, is a disgrace."
Professional Footballers Australia (PFA) called for an independent investigation into how the match was allowed to go ahead given the "deplorable state" of the pitch, which the body said posed a "clear danger" to "player safety".
"The players confirmed with us last night that they were not consulted at any stage on whether or not the match should proceed, notwithstanding the clear issues that the pitch presented to their livelihoods," chief executive John Didulica said in a statement.
"The PFA will ... recommend two clear resolutions for adoption. Firstly, that FFA immediately commission an independent investigation into the process undertaken to approve last night's match as being fit for play.
"Secondly, endorse a motion that players will no longer play on surfaces unacceptably compromised by a cricket wicket."
Sydney FC, whose victory kept them second in the A-League, are scheduled to host league leaders Perth Glory at the ground on April 18.
"The pitch clearly wasn't up to the standards required for professional football and we are working with the SCG Trust and FFA to assess its suitability to host our game against Perth in 11 days' time," said Sydney FC chief executive Danny Townsend.
"All options are on the table, including moving the game, and those discussions are already underway."
Some 3,000 square metres of turf at the ground were replaced last month after huge divots came up during a rugby union match between the New South Wales Waratahs and Queensland Reds.
The Sydney Roosters rugby league team have also used the ground and the various codes have varied the layout of the pitch in order to mitigate the impact of the three different types of grass on the surface.
The SCG has hosted test cricket since 1882 and was the venue for hundreds of rugby league and union matches before the SFS was completed in 1988. It has also been the home of the Sydney Swans Australian Rules team since 1982.
Didulica said the presence of a cricket wicket on a playing surface presented "an unreasonable danger to the health and safety of footballers".
"It remains the view of the PFA that players are under no obligation to participate in matches when such risks are present. This includes the SCG."

MELBOURNE  Australian outside back Jack Maddocks is trying hard not to think about wearing the Wallabies jersey at the upcoming World Cup but it is getting more difficult every time he crosses the try-line for the Melbourne Rebels.
The talented 22-year-old, who made his test debut last year, grabbed two tries in the win over the Queensland Reds last weekend to lead Super Rugby with eight from six games.
His rollicking start to the season has put him among the players first picked by pundits tipping the make-up of Michael Cheika's squad for Japan but the man affectionately nicknamed "Mad Dog" is determined not to get ahead of himself.
"Obviously it's the pinnacle of rugby. So growing up, I always watched the World Cup, whenever it was on," he told reporters in Melbourne on Friday.
"This year I haven't put much thought to it, to be honest. I think I'm sort of one of those people that gets motivated by day-to-day things. If I look to far ahead I sort of get off track.
"My sole focus so far has just been on the Rebels."
An imposing 6ft-4in in height and very quick, Maddocks won his first test cap off the bench against the All Blacks in Sydney last year, got his first start in the return match in Auckland and featured in seven tests in all.
Despite his personal breakthrough, it was a grim start to his international career, with the team losing six of those matches and nine out of 13 for the season.
Maddocks has enjoyed more team success at provincial level, with the Rebels enjoying rare air at the top of the Australian Conference with four wins from six games.
Former Wallabies flyhalf Quade Cooper has been key in the positive start for the Rebels and Maddocks, and he set up both his team mate's tries against the Reds with deft kicking.
With Cooper also in good form since reuniting with scrumhalf Will Genia, his old Queensland Reds mucker, it's not too much of a stretch to see the three Rebels combining in Japan.
Maddocks said there was little planning behind the mercurial Cooper's array of cross-field kicks and other tricks.
"I think he's just sort of one of those instinctual players where he has the feel for the game and can feel where you are," Maddocks said of the 70-test Wallaby.
"It probably looks a lot more planned that it is.
"We just sort of connect up pretty naturally."
Maddocks will look to add to his try tally at home on Saturday against the Tokyo-based Sunwolves, who have claimed pioneering wins in New Zealand and in Australia this season, felling the New South Wales Waratahs in Sydney last week.
The Sunwolves play a similar brand of running rugby to the Rebels and Maddocks said that would suit his team just fine.
"They've got a few really good kickers in their side," he said.
"They'll probably put us to work in the backfield but I think that sort of suits us because we get the ball and get to play and that excites us."

A day after reports that he will have shoulder surgery to fix a torn labrum, Dallas Cowboys defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence confirmed Monday he expects to miss the preseason while recovering in hopes of playing in Week 1.
Fresh off reaching a five-year deal to remain in Dallas, Lawrence said on The Rich Eisen Show that he will undergo surgery on Wednesday after putting off the procedure while he sorted out his contract, reportedly worth $105 million.
Lawrence, 26, played through the injury in the 2018 season and led the Cowboys with 10.5 sacks. The two-time Pro Bowler has 25 sacks over the past two seasons, with no other Cowboy recording double digits over the same span.
In five seasons in Dallas, Lawrence has a combined 34 sacks and 200 tackles in 64 games (47 starts). The Cowboys selected the Boise State product in the second round of the 2014 NFL Draft.
--The Kansas City Chiefs have reached agreement with linebacker Jeremiah Attaochu, according to the sports agency SportsTrust that represents the 26-year-old.
Attaochu played his first four NFL seasons (2014-17) with the Chargers -- three in San Diego, one in Los Angeles -- so he is mighty familiar with the AFC West. He had 10 sacks in 38 games (13 starts) with the Chargers. Attaochu was originally picked in the second round of the 2014 NFL Draft by the Chargers.
He signed with the San Francisco 49ers as a free agent in March 2018 but didn't make the team and was released. The New York Jets picked up Attaochu two days later and he had two sacks in 11 games.
--The Arizona Cardinals re-signed defensive tackle Rodney Gunter to a one-year contract, the team announced.
Gunter reportedly made a free-agent visit to the Green Bay Packers last week. The 27-year-old Gunter established career highs of 44 tackles and 4.5 sacks last year in his fourth season with the Cardinals. He has 95 tackles and eight sacks in 64 career games (25 starts).
The Cardinals also announced that they signed two offensive linemen who played for the recently disbanded Alliance of American Football: Andrew Lauderdale (Arizona Hotshots) and Jeremiah Poutasi (Salt Lake City Stallions).
--The Carolina Panthers announced the signing of five players, highlighted by former Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Destiny Vaeao and four others with experience in the now-suspended Alliance of American Football.
Vaeao, 25, has played parts of three seasons with the Eagles since signing as an undrafted free agent out of Washington State in 2016. He was cut by the Eagles last October and was signed to the New York Jets practice squad the following month, but never saw regular-season action.
In addition, the Panthers added four others who played in the AAF. The group includes Rashad Ross, 29, who caught 36 passes for 583 yards (16.2 yards per catch) and a league-best seven touchdowns for the Arizona Hotshots. His signing initially was reported on Thursday.
--The Miami Dolphins have reached a one-year deal with former Cleveland Browns wide receiver Ricardo Louis, according to multiple reports.
A fourth-round pick by the Browns in 2016, the 6-foot-2, 215-pound Louis missed all of last season with a neck injury that he had surgically repaired before training camp.
The two seasons prior, Louis appeared in all 32 games with 12 starts, catching 45 passes for 562 yards. He also averaged 18.2 yards on nine kickoff returns as a rookie after running a 4.43-second 40-yard dash at the Combine.
--Former rugby player Christian Wade has been allocated to the Buffalo Bills as part of the NFL's International Player Pathway Program, the team announced.
The 5-foot-8, 190-pound Wade was a highly decorated rugby star in the United Kingdom, having played for the national team at the U16, U18 and U20 levels, as well as making the British and Irish Lions squad. He retired from the rugby union last year to pursue playing in the NFL.
Wade's 82 tries (touchdowns) in Premiership Rugby, mostly as a ballcarrier, is third all-time and he has been designated as a running back with the Bills.
Wade, 27, is one of seven international athletes from five countries who have been training in Florida with the goal of landing one of four placements among AFC East teams this offseason. He participated in a pro day last week, where he was timed at 4.53 seconds in the 40-yard dash.
The four clubs will be allowed to carry an extra player (91 total) during training camp and, should the player not make the final roster, will also receive an extra practice squad spot for the allotted player. However, those placed on the practice squad with the international player exemption will be ineligible to be activated during the season.

BURNLEY, England  When Mike Phelan was asked if he would like to return to Manchester United and assist Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in turning the club around after the sacking of Jose Mourinho in December, he barely paused for thought before agreeing.
Having enjoyed plenty of success at Old Trafford as Alex Ferguson's trusted right-hand man, the chance to return after a six year absence was not an opportunity the 56-year-old was going to let pass.
But while that was an instant decision, there had been plenty of contemplation during his time away from the club.
"I had a time of reflection. I felt that I needed to look back and examine the processes that were in place. Because you just don't get the time when you are actually 'in it'," he told Reuters at his East Lancashire home.
Phelan wanted to look back to find out exactly how United had enjoyed such dominance and conversations with Ferguson and former United CEO David Gill formed part of that process.
But after a brief spell as manager of Hull City in the 2016-17 season, with the club poorly resourced and heading for relegation, Phelan took time away from the game and decided to extend that investigation of leadership skills.
"I thought I needed to find out more. I am quite an open-minded sort of fella and the more people you meet, the more areas of expertise you venture into, you find yourself searching for that common denominator," he said.
Phelan talked to people in rugby and other sports and looked at American coaching and management methods as well as the world of business.
"What I found was that the simplicity in most things tends to be the most effective. We are all looking for the secret ingredient but when you start to talk to people at the elite level, the top end, you find they do the simple things better than most people," added the former United player.
COLLABORATION
As Phelan describes the conclusions he reached, it is also evident they have been put into practise at United since December.
"The (leaders) communicate better and they actually hand over the reigns to people to get on with their jobs. You bring people into your environment, you communicate well, you express your thought process and then you hand it over and see what comes back," he said.
A look at the technical area during games reveals that approach in action. Solskjaer is in charge but Phelan frequently is out on the touch-line guiding players and the other coaches, Michael Carrick and Kieran McKenna, are also part of the collaboration.
"I like the idea of sharing, seeing people grow, (then) the end product," he says.
Still, Phelan has been surprised how quickly Solskjaer was able to change the mood at the club, bringing back a sense of enjoyment.
"It was an instant response," he says, noting the way that Solskjaer created a "breath of fresh air" around the club's Carrington training complex.
SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT
The challenge, now that the Norwegian has been appointed the long-term manager, is to turn that 'bounce' into a more substantial improvement. Phelan believes they are helped by having players who still have plenty of scope for improvement, none more so than Paul Pogba.
Pogba looked unhappy and unsettled during the latter period of Mourinho's time at the club but has shone since the change.
"I think that happened to quite a few players, they probably drew into themselves a little bit and were very cautious," says Phelan.
"Paul had a spell where all the eyes were on him and delivery of his best wasn't there all the time, the consistency.
"Now we are trying to apply ourselves to Paul's game. Ole has done a terrific job at helping Paul through certain spells and he has embraced that. He is maturing all the time.
"He is not the finished deal even though everyone looks at him and sees a World Cup winner already but he is not the finished deal, there is still a lot more to come and that is the exciting bit about United.
"There are players there who haven't achieved for the club what they need to achieve and we want to make sure that they relish that experience, embrace the opportunity to win things at Manchester United."
Another of those players is left back Luke Shaw, who has significantly improved in recent months.
"We think that there is more to come from Luke  he is young, he is energetic and he has an attitude which is developing all the time. We feel that the world is his oyster... he is a huge player," says Phelan.
GLORY DAYS
With United facing Barcelona in a Champions League quarter-final first leg on Wednesday, there is the sense of the club being on the right path to rediscovering their glory days.
Phelan certainly doesn't feel the past is a weight on the club nor has that success reduced his own personal hunger.
"I want these players to enjoy their own great moments for themselves but I also want to do it again  that is the drive," he said.
"It is different this time around, of course it is. It was six years ago, but it is not impossible, definitely not impossible."

As commander of the coalition forces in Iraq, Maj. Gen. Walter Piatt juggled ruthless pursuit of enemies and delicate diplomacy with tribal leaders, using a trove of modern weaponry and streams of tech-generated data.
But his best decisions, he said, relied on a tool as ancient as it is powerful. Maj. Gen. Piatt often began daily operations by breathing deliberately, slack-jawed, staring steadily at a palm tree.
Mindfulness  the practice of using breathing techniques, similar to those in meditation, to gain focus and reduce distraction  is inching into the military in the United States and those of a handful of other nations.

This winter, Army infantry soldiers at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii began using mindfulness to improve shooting skills  for instance, focusing on when to pull the trigger amid chaos to avoid unnecessary civilian harm.
The British Royal Navy has given mindfulness training to officers, and military leaders are rolling it out in the Army and Royal Air Force for some officers and enlisted soldiers. TheNew Zealand Defence Forcerecently adopted the technique, and military forces of the Netherlands are considering the idea, too.
This week, NATO plans to hold a two-day symposium in Berlin to discuss the evidence behind the use of mindfulness in the military.
A small but growing group of military officials support the techniques to heal trauma-stressed veterans, make command decisions and help soldiers in chaotic battles.
I was asked recently if my soldiers call me General Moonbeam, said Maj. Gen. Piatt, who was director of operations for the Army and now commands its 10th Mountain Division. Theres a stereotype this makes you soft. No, it brings you on point.

The approach, he said, is based onthe work of Amishi Jha, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Miami. She is the senior author of a paper published in December about the trainings effectiveness among members of a special operations unit.
The paper, in the journal Progress in Brain Research, reported that the troops who went through a monthlong training regimen that included daily practice in mindful breathing and focus techniqueswere better able to discern key information under chaotic circumstances and experienced increases in working memory function. The soldiers also reported making fewer cognitive errors than service members who did not use mindfulness.
The findings, which build on previous research showing improvements among soldiers andprofessional football playerstrained in mindfulness, are significant in part because members of the special forces are already selected for their ability to focus. The fact that even they saw improvement speaks to the power of the training, Dr. Jha said.
Theyre the best, and what theyre trying to do is the hardest, she said.
Dr. Jha has spoken to the United States Army War College and the British Parliament, and she has been a consultant to New Zealands Defence Force and military officials in the Netherlands. When the special forces do something, she said, not only does the rest of the U.S. military pay attention, but the rest of the worlds militaries pay attention.
The science shows that techniques that focus and calm the mind allow people to perform better and make them less likely to overreact to incoming stimulation  whether a flash of movement, sound or an onslaught of information on a device.
The neuroscience of mindfulness involves, in part, strengthening a part of mental capacity known as working memory  a short-term, moment-to-moment catalog of tasks understood by scientists to effectively hold only a few pieces of information at one time.
As working memory clouds through overload, decisions become jumbled and reactions more impulsive. Breathing-induced focus lets people home in on the task at hand. But it does take practice.
The recent study found that service members who train for four weeks experience significant improvement, but those who train for only two weeks do not.
The mindfulness training comes as the military is exploring other options to intensify soldier focus, even the possibility ofimplanting computer chipsinto soldiers brains. But those potential solutions are expensive and years off.
Widespread adoption of mindfulness has challenges, including creating a staff of trainers, said Commander William MacNulty, a commissioned officer in the United States Public Health Service. He helped train a special forces unit in mindfulness (the precise military branch and location are confidential). The program entailed the soldiers spending about 15 minutes each day performing recorded, guided breathing exercises.
Mr. MacNulty said that about a third of the soldiers readily embraced the idea, a third engaged with curiosity, and a third seemed skeptical.
Mr. MacNulty likened the benefits of practicing mindfulness to those of, say, doing push-ups. You might not drop and do push-ups when youre in a gunfight, but you have increased capacity, he said. Thats true of mindfulness, he added: Mental focus becomes a transferable skill.
In the newsmagazine of the Royal New Zealand Air Force, the militaryexplained the rationale behind adopting mindfulness. Referring to the national rugby team, the magazine said: The All Blacks talk about red head/blue head  red head means being in a flustered state and blue head means being calm, centred and able to make clearheaded decisions.
Research also has shown that use of mindfulnesscan help soldiers overcome post-traumatic stress disorder.
That has been the experience of Britains chief evangelist for use of mindfulness in the military, CommanderTim Boughton.
Mr. Boughton, decorated for service in many combat zones, discovered when he retired from active duty in 2008 that hed grown withdrawn and angered by the horrors hed seen: mangled civilian bodies fused together in combat zones; deaths of 48 compatriots in battle in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Falklands, Northern Ireland; ethnic cleansing, hand-to-hand stuff.
When he went to a psychiatrist in 2008, she broke down in tears after he described his experiences. Mr. Boughton discovered mindfulness after his own bout with PTSD, eventually becoming a trustee of the Oxford University Mindfulness Center.
He now starts and ends his day with five minutes of breathing exercises. He uses the technique each time he is gripped by anxiety or panic. The traumas havent disappeared, he said, but he isnt haunted by them daily. Now he can more calmly examine each terrible incident, address it and have some control over it  rather than merely reacting.
The amount of brain power it frees by not being trapped in the past or the future is incredible, Mr. Boughton said. The military is seeing the mass benefits of this.
Mr. Boughton has thought about whether mindfulness is anathema to conflict. The purists would say that mindfulness was never developed for war purpose, he said.
What he means is that mindfulness is often associated with peacefulness. But, he added, the idea is to be as faithful to compassionate and humane ideals as possible given the realities of the job.
Maj. Gen. Piatt underscored that point, describing one delicate diplomatic mission in Iraq that involved meeting with a local tribal leader. Before the session, he said, he meditated in front of a palm tree, and found himself extremely focused when the delicate conversation took place shortly thereafter.
I was not taking notes. I remember every word she was saying. I wasnt forming a response, just listening, he said. When the tribal leader finished, he said, I talked back to her about every single point, had to concede on some. I remember the expression on her face: This is someone we can work with.
In the end, he said, mindfulness allowed him to reduce conflict by better understanding.
Im not saying, be soft, he added. Im saying, understand how compassion and empathy can be used for real advantages.
Peace takes a lot of hard work.
An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the All Blacks. The phrase describes a prominent rugby team in New Zealand, not the national air force.

Good morning.
New Zealandinvestigates how the massacre could have been avoided,Chinagets a toehold in Europe andAppleprepares to unveil its next big thing. Heres the latest:
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern orderedan inquiry into whether government agenciescould have prevented the attacks at two mosques in Christchurch on Friday that left at least 50 dead.
Her cabinet also agreed in principle to overhaul the countrys gun laws and will announce reforms within 10 days of this horrific act of terrorism, she said at a news conference.
The victims:New Zealands deputy police commissioner said specialists had worked through the night to identify the people killed at the Al Noor and Linwood mosques. Islamic leaders and victims families have been discussing holding a burial for all victims, possibly on Wednesday.
The suspect:Our reporter went to the town of Dunedin, home to the suspected gunman, and spoke to people he interacted with, including members of his rifle club.
Perspective:Our Opinion section has essays examining thetraits white supremacist terrorists have in commonand thehistory of white supremacist violence.
At least one gunman opened fire on a tram in the city of Utrecht,killing three people and injuring five more.
Officials arrested a suspect  a 37-year-old Turkish-born man  after an eight-hour manhunt, but its still unclear whether he was the only person involved in the attack.
Authorities said they were looking into the possibility the shooting was an act of terror, with the counterterrorism agency raising its threat assessment to the highest level. They had also ordered the evacuation of all mosques in the city, but its unclear if that move stems from a specific threat or as a precaution in the wake of the attack in New Zealand. But they didnt rule out other motives, and some reports suggested the attack was the result of a domestic dispute.
Context:The city of Utrecht has a large immigrant population, with more than 30 percent of residents born outside the Netherlands. The attack took place in the Kanaleneiland neighborhood, home to a large number of Muslims, including immigrants from Morocco and Turkey.
This week, President Xi Jinping isexpected to arrive in Rome to sign a dealthat would make Italy the first Group of 7 nation to participate in Beijings global Belt and Road initiative.
The deal would open Italy to greater Chinese infrastructure investment in exchange for favorable customs conditions and a faster trade route into the heart of Europe.
The vast project is already underway in the port city of Trieste. Construction workers in scuba gear have been laying foundations near the site of a new pier. Other cities up for a transformation include Genoa and Palermo.
Concerns:The U.S. and E.U. powers like Germany and France have been wary of Beijings Belt and Road project, casting it as an economic and perhaps even military threat.
Supporters of the plan in Italy, however, have few reservations, saying the countrys laws protect its autonomy.
The kingdom has a history of going after dissidents and other Saudi citizens abroad, butthe efforts escalated sharply after Prince Mohammed bin Salman was elevatedto crown prince in 2017.
The prince authorized a clandestine campaign that included the surveillance, kidnapping, detention and torture of Saudi citizens, according to American officials who have read classified reports about the efforts.
Since then, Saudi security forces have detaineddozens of clerics, intellectuals and activists who were perceived to pose a threat, as well as people who had posted critical or sarcastic comments about the government on Twitter.
Details:At least a dozen missions were carried out by the same team that killed Jamal Khashoggi in October, suggesting that the gruesome murder was part of a broader push, according to officials and associates of some of the Saudi victims.
The group behind Mr. Khashoggis killing, which American officials called the Saudi Rapid Intervention Group, also forcibly repatriated Saudis from other Arab countries and detained and abused prisoners in palaces belonging to the crown prince and his father, King Salman.
Afghanistan:Three months after the countrys soccer chief, Keramuddin Keram, was accused of sexually abusing members of the womens national team,an investigation has stalled, amid fears it will never proceed.
Britain:The speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, warned Prime Minister Theresa May thatshe could not hold a third vote in Parliament on her beleaguered Brexit planunless it was substantially different from the proposal already been rejected twice.
India:Gauri Lankesh, a journalist who railed against the right-wing Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., wasshot dead in September. We take a deep look at her story and what it reveals about the countrys increasingly intolerant politics.
The Philippines:A beached whaledied with 88 pounds of plastic trash inside its body, an unusually large amount that brought renewed attention to ocean pollution.
#MeToo:Nearly 100 female economists in the U.S. say that a peer or colleague has sexually assaulted them, and nearly 200 say they were the victims of an attempted assault,according to a new surveythat reveals deep evidence of gender and racial discrimination in the field.
Lyft:The ride-hailing app  and Ubers main rival in North America  hopes to be valued atup to $23 billion, according to filings ahead of its initial public offering, most likely the years biggest.
The Prado:As Spains national art museum celebratesits bicentennial, our writer  who has visited more than 200 times  returned to every gallery, vestibule and passageway.
Apple:The tech giants next big product isnt a new device, but a billion-dollar-plus foray into streaming video. The company isexpected to reveal details of the project next week.
Spain:A bar in Madrid celebrating the dictator Gen. Francisco Franco andcatering to the radical rightis run by a Chinese man  an irony that has not gone unnoticed by patrons. We used to joke to him, one said. If Franco was still alive, he would kill you.

New Zealanders have lit candles, piled flowers and stood vigil since a gunman attacked two mosques in Christchurch, killing at least 50 people.
They have also performed the haka.
The ceremonial dance originated with the Maori, the countrys indigenous Polynesian inhabitants. Warriors danced to intimidate opponents with grimaces, chanting and aggressive postures. But there are also hakas of welcome and hakas for funerals.
The form has been embraced by New Zealanders of all origins, most famously by the national rugby team, the All Blacks. Many schools have haka groups, and every two years, theres a national competition hosted by one of the countrys iwi, or tribes.
A variety of haka have beenperformed for the Christchurch victims. For instance, a biker group, Black Power, useda warlike haka to express solidarity.
Others performed one of the most famous hakas,Ka mate,a tribute to life in the face of death.
