QUICK QUOTES FROM:
MATT KUCHAR
Q. (No Microphone.)
MATT KUCHAR: Probably the guys that didn't play well.
(Laughter.)
Q. How about the guys in the middle?
MATT KUCHAR: I don't know. Everybody's got to play the same course. I don't know why as long as the ball won't stop, everybody's got to play it.
Q. Let's assume that Phil wins. I know it's a big allusion. But what do you think that means for the Tournament itself?
MATT KUCHAR: I think it's going to be great regardless. You got Stricker, Hunter, Justin Rose. Everybody's a fantastic name up there. It's an awesome leaderboard.
Q. And Phil has come so close so many times. What do you think that says about his resiliency?
MATT KUCHAR: He's a fantastic player. It shows that just his career record on the PGA TOUR, I don't know how many, 40 something wins or something like that, it's just, he's a great player and you figure he's going to get one sooner or later.
Q. Winning or not winning a U.S. Open doesn't define Phil Mickelson, is what you're saying?
MATT KUCHAR: You got to ask Phil.
Q. Would you welcome a championship coming back here at Merion?
MATT KUCHAR: Yeah, it's awesome. I hope sooner the better.
Q. It's been five years since Tiger won a Major. Can you talk about that?
MATT KUCHAR: It's a good question. I don't know. There's still a lot of time left. I think what was Hogan won how many after 36? How many did Hogan win after the age of 36? So it's still doable.
Q. Where would you rank this golf course as far as toughness is concerned?
MATT KUCHAR: One of the Top 10 for sure. No question.
Q. What makes it so tough?
MATT KUCHAR: Nobody can break par.
Q. (No Microphone.)
MATT KUCHAR: I don't think any worse. I definitely don't work any worse.
Q. (No Microphone.)
MATT KUCHAR: At first I thought I might go see Philly, but there were a lot of late nights and unfortunately I wasn't able to make it down.

Priyanka Chopra's film with Chris Pratt shelved? Here is the truth
by Winston Welch
in Culture&Arts
 Aug 8, 2018
Share:
The upcoming movie Cowboy Ninja Viking, starring Chris Pratt and Priyanka Chopra, has been removed from Universal Pictures' release schedule. Without a given reason, the studio has pulled it from its original June 28, 2019 release date.
The novel is about an assassin who posses the toughest skills of a Cowboy, a Ninja, and a Viking; hence the name.
Cowboy Ninja Viking was due to be the directorial debut of Michelle MacLaren (Game Of Thrones), adapted from the cult comic by A.J. Lieberman and Riley Rossmo. According to reports, "Cowboy Ninja Wiking" was scheduled to begin shooting in the next month.
The film, nonetheless, remains in active development.
Quantico actress Priyanka Chopra had been in negotiations to join Pratt, playing the female lead; if the film moves ahead in the future, it's expected that the role will still be hers, provided she can accommodate the new schedule.
When the film might score another release date remains to be seen, but Universal certainly seems to think it'll still get made; just not yet. She is also developing The Nightingale, a WWII thriller that is set up over at Tr-Star. Craig Mazin wrote the draft with Deadpool writers Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese. Yes, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom has turned a huge profit for Universal, but the sequel will still come in about $400 million below the first film, and let's not forget that Pratt's expensive sci-fi movie Passengers, which paired him with a strong box office draw in Jennifer Lawrence, barely turned a profit. MacLaren and Pratt will still remain attached to the project, with Chopra staying on if the scheduling ultimately works out. But turns out that will have to wait because the movie has been delayed indefinitely.

Your Guide To The Best Private Race Track Clubs In The U.S.
11/07/2018 mediabest Car Reviews
These are the best exclusive facilities where you can safely and legally race your own car.
Its my happy place, a private club member says. I forget about work for a few hours and hang out with my best friends. The private facility is in New Yorks Catskills, with acres of lush grass and forested hills. High topiary walls hide it from public view. Its gorgeous, right? the member adds.
Then he jams on a full-face helmet and jumps into an orange Porsche GT3 RS sports car. Oh yeah, he shouts. And I get to go really, really fast.
When you overhear friends talking about the healthy competition at their private club, the hazards on the courses back half, or the $100,000 initiation fee, you can no longer simply assume theyre talking about golf.

Hop on a Roll in the New Year: Love
March 13, 2019 0 Comment eflbridges
Champions get on a ROLL and also have winning streaks and this is what divides those that achieve from those who do not. Achievers have objectives, construct on one success after one more, and also reach their fixed destination.
ROLL is an acronym (Read, Observe, Listen, Love) as well as it is your map to obtain you from where you are to where you intend to be. Formerly weve gone over how to get rolling via Read, Observe, and also Listen. The final step will certainly supply momentum to keep your ROLL going. It is Love.
Some might recommend that Love should precede. If we like something, somebody, or if we provide love, wouldnt whatever else form? Love is the answer and love conquers all.
In some cases love will certainly come first and supply the momentum we require to persist in the face of obstacle. When we love somebody we will go to great lengths for them. Well review their state of minds and also feelings, observing whatever concerning them, and listening to whatever stated and unsaid. With love for someone we subconsciously go the 2nd mile.
But sometimes we dont like that which we seek in the beginning. Proceeding with our boat instance from previous articles in this series, couple of will certainly like boating up until they have experience on a boat. While some will certainly love boating right away, several will certainly expand their affection for boating with time through reading, observing, and also paying attention.
In this way dropping in love is truly an aware choice created by a series of selections and actions. You see, as soon as in a lifetime we may fall in love prima facie, yet the majority of the time in life we choose to be in love. What should we pick to love? Thats the best component: We reach select.
This implies we can select to like virtually anyone or anything. Right heres where it gets intriguing. Love is frequently the outcome of selections made as well as activities taken that unwittingly lead us to fall in love. Love, while a strange emotion that commonly appears to find on without warning, can be consciously chosen.
And that is why you should Read, Observe, as well as Listen. Everyone recognizes we hang out with and also think of most those individuals as well as things we love.
If we spend our time reading, observing, and paying attention to as well as about that which we want we will certainly nearly definitely begin to enjoy it as well.
Does that mean we will soon own a watercraft if we just Read, Observe, Listen, and inevitably Love? Really, when it involves worldly points, yes.
We will not spend the time reading, observing, as well as paying attention unless we ultimately love it. And as soon as we remain in love, well relocate mountains to have it.
Love is the response. Love overcomes all.
Choose to enjoy people; all people. Picking love will conquer all. Because Love begets Love.
Glen Gould helps business people locate interest, provide exceptional customer care, attach much better, close more, and discover higher pleasure as well as freedom with their job.
Throughout his time as a golf specialist, Glen started to really research successful people and organizations with the objective of learning what they do, how they do it, and replicating their outcomes.
Today Glen inspires target markets to achieve even more with enjoyable as well as thought-provoking talks that include role-playing, interaction, and also sometimes simply simple fun.
ROLL is an acronym (Read, Observe, Listen, Love) and it is your map to get you from where you are to where you want to be. If we like something, somebody, or if we offer love, would not every little thing else fall right into place? Love is the answer and love dominates all.
You see, once in a life time we may fall in love at first view, but most of the time in life we decide to be in love. Since Love results in Love.

Three main languages were spoken in the medieval duchy of Brittany: Latin, Breton and French. After briefly considering the geographical division between Breton- and French-speaking parts of the duchy, notably the way in which Breton was progressively restricted to the western half of the duchy, this paper examines how French came, with a few exceptions, to replace Latin as the principal language of record and administration in Brittany in the course of the later Middle Ages. The duchy is shown to fit into a wider regional pattern in the adoption of French in neighbouring provinces, whilst displaying its own particular characteristics. The role of the nobility is probably more significant than that of the ducal administration in explaining the initial spread in usage; the relative lack of urban influence reflects the under-developed character of Breton town life until the end of the Middle Ages. Ecclesiastical authorities also began to use or accept French for certain kinds of business from an early stage, though in the case of parish registers, introduced in the early fifteenth century, Latin was the main language, and often remained so in Breton-speaking regions until the seventeenth century. Some differences in the usage of French between different parts of Breton-speaking Brittany are noted, while the chronology of the adoption of French for different types of record demonstrates that the process occurred unevenly over a long period of time and that social, cultural and political reasons must be considered for its adoption.
Trois langues principales étaient pratiquées dans le duché de Bretagne au Moyen Âge : le latin, le breton, le français. Après un bref rappel de la répartition spatiale du breton et du français, et spécialement de la façon dont le breton fut progressivement cantonné dans la partie occidentale du duché, larticle étudie la façon dont le français en arriva, sauf rares exceptions, à remplacer le latin comme langue principale des documents et de ladministration en Bretagne durant les derniers siècles du Moyen Âge. Le duché vit se reproduire le schéma de ladoption du français dans les provinces voisines, mais avec quelques spécificités. Le rôle de la noblesse y fut sans doute plus déterminant, dans les premières étapes, que celui de ladministration ducale ; labsence relative dinfluence urbaine reflète le retard breton en matière de vie municipale jusquà la fin du Moyen Âge. Les autorités ecclésiastiques elles aussi se mirent rapidement à utiliser ou à tolérer le français pour certains types daffaires, même si les registres paroissiaux, introduits au début du XVe siècle, conservèrent largement lusage du latin, qui dominait souvent encore au XVIIe siècle dans les régions bretonnantes. On peut noter quelques divergences dans lusage du français entre les diverses zones qui parlaient breton, tandis que la chronologie de ladoption du français pour différents types de documents révéle une progression lente, à un rythme inégal, soumise à lentrecroisement complexe de facteurs sociaux, culturels et politiques.
In memoriam Hubert Guillotel
1. Breton and French
Three main languages were spoken in the medieval duchy of Brittany: Latin, Breton and French. Modern Breton, of which there is still no agreed standard version, survives in four main forms. These reflect historical differences in ways of speaking and writing the language, centring on the four western Breton dioceses of Cornouaille (Quimper), St-Pol de Léon, Tréguier and Vannes1. The French spoken in medieval Brittany also displays regional characteristics when compared with that of neighbouring Francophone regions, some even deeming the differences so marked as to form a distinct sub-language known as Gallo, Gallot or Gallèse, itself significantly influenced by Breton2. Conversely, Middle Breton (the Breton spoken from around 1100 to the seventeenth century) made borrowings from French, especially from the fourteenth century onwards3. Latin was, of course, universally used throughout the duchy during the Middle Ages, preserving its importance in certain kinds of written record, and enjoying a revival as elsewhere during the Renaissance as a literary language. But the fluctuating linguistic boundary between Breton- and French-speaking parts of the duchy  Bretagne-bretonnante and Bretagne-gallo  during our period needs discussion because of the consequences this has for any account of the spread of French as a written language, especially in administrative and diplomatic documents, which are the main focus of this paper.
Briefly (since this has much exercised literary and historical scholars), following the immigration of Britons into the Armorican peninsula between the fourth and seventh centuries AD, Breton developed as a separate language within a larger group (Breton, Cornish and Welsh) that formed one of two distinct branches (the other made up of Irish and Scottish Gaelic and Manx) of Celtic-speaking peoples inhabiting the western seaboard of Europe and the British Isles in the early Middle Ages4. I leave aside here the thorny issue of what Primitive Breton may have acquired from the indigenous Gaulish, also a Celtic language, spoken in Armorica in Roman times5. Within what from the tenth century was usually termed the duchy of Brittany, there is place- and personal-name evidence that Breton was at least briefly spoken as far east as the Bay of Mont-Saint-Michel on the north coast and in the Pays de Guérande at the mouth of the Loire on the south coast. Following work by Paul Sébillot and the great Celticist Joseph Loth, since 1886 a line, often termed the Loth line, drawn southwards from the mouth of the Couesnon next to Mont-Saint-Michel, passing through Hédé, then to the west of Rennes and Bain de Bretagne to reach the Loire just east of Donges, has been taken to indicate the extreme eastern limits of Old Breton speech 6.
2. The retreat of Breton
By the later Middle Ages there had been a significant retreat westwards, a development that was certainly by then venerable. Around 1500, the equivalent of the Loth line for the Middle Breton then spoken ran southwards from the western side of the Bay of St-Brieuc, east of Quintin, west of Loudéac and Josselin, east of La Roche Bernard and reached the sea near modern St-Nazaire7. Subsequent centuries have seen a further slow shift to a parallel line some 15 or 20 kilometres further west marking the limits of Modern Breton speech, though between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries the linguistic frontier was for long apparently static before shifting again, especially dramatically, in the twentieth century8. By 1976 it ran south-eastwards from the north coast, west of Plouha, Corlay and Mur de Bretagne, and east of Pontivy, to reach the sea on the Golfe du Morbihan, the most significant recent regression being the withdrawal of Vannes and the Presquîle du Rhuys from the area in which Breton was still extensively spoken as late as 19419. From at least the mid fourteenth century, administratively the medieval duchy was divided into Haute- and Basse-Bretagne, Bretagne-gallo and Bretagne-bretonnante, roughly approximating to the linguistic division of 1500 sketched above, which was first depicted cartographically in Bertrand dArgentrés Histoire de Bretagne in 158810. The church too had by then long recognized distinctions in speech between the various Breton dioceses. This means that the eastern Breton dioceses of Dol (apart from its enclaves along the northern coast), Nantes (apart from the Guérandais), Rennes and St-Malo were French-speaking while St-Brieuc and Vannes had both French- and Breton-speaking populations, and Quimper, St-Pol de Léon and Tréguier were essentially Breton-speaking11.
Evidence from written sources provides a particular gloss on the way in which French came to be used more extensively for administrative purposes, even in nominally Breton-speaking areas in the later Middle Ages. This is chiefly provided by documents produced, in the earliest periods, by monastic scriptoria, more sparingly by cathedral chapters, then increasingly by the embryonic ducal administration, eventually with its chancery, a surge in records relating to the secular affairs of leading noble families and a wealth of other documents concerning every aspect of life in town and countryside. No attempt is made here to look at the place of literary works which can be shown more or less convincingly to have been written by authors or scribes writing in French in Brittany. An early example might be the Roman dAiquin, a mediocre chanson de geste relating the adventures of a Saracen prince, whom the Du Guesclin family took to be among their ancestors12. This was probably composed in the diocese of St-Malo around 1200 and is traditionally attributed to a jongleur Garin Trousseboeuf. Others might include poems attributed to Peter Mauclerc, duke of Brittany (1213-37) or his son, John I (1237-86) in contemporary chansonniers13, though it is not until the mid and late fourteenth century that more significant historical and literary works in French by Bretons begin to proliferate convincingly14. In passing, we may note too that there are few substantial Breton Latin chronicles from the High Middle Ages, the most important being the Chronicle of Nantes, though this has come down to us in fragmentary and macaronic form, largely thanks to Pierre Le Baud (d. 1505), the most significant Breton historian of his generation15.
3. Monastic records and language
I shall now concentrate chiefly on the period when French came to stand alongside and then largely replace Latin for administrative purposes, except in certain categories of document (for example, notarial instruments16), that is the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries, but with some forays outside these centuries. Inevitably the way in which written records were first principally preserved by religious houses and cathedral chapters has skewed the sample towards the ecclesiastical evidence. But sufficient survives to make some distinctions between the use of the vernacular by lay authorities and ecclesiastical ones, and to trace the physical spread of French usage as a language of record throughout the duchy.
Brittany is relatively poor in terms of charters dating before the mid eleventh century, but there is one major exception  the Cartulary of the Benedictine abbey of Saint-Sauveur of Redon, founded in 83217. This cartulary, compiled between c. 1070 and 1161, is chiefly remarkable for copies of nearly 350 charters of the ninth and early tenth centuries. Located close to the linguistic boundary between Breton- and French-speaking areas in the eastern Vannetais, but relating to properties scattered in a radius of upto 70 kilometres from the abbey, the Latin charters of the Carolingian period provide rich evidence in place- and personal-names and in terms for a variety of social and economic practices, some of Celtic origin18. They suggest that Breton was currently widely spoken on the estates coming into the monks hands and was clearly understood by the clerks responsible for drafting the original charters. There is less evidence in these charters for early Romance-speech in the Redon region, though there is some. By the time the Carolingian charters were copied into the cartulary itself (around 1070), after a period of disruption brought about by the Vikings, the later copyist/s were now largely ignorant of Breton, an early indicator of the retreat of Breton speech to the late medieval Loth line19.
Two other monastic cartularies contain a substantial number of Latin charters from Breton-speaking areas  those of Landévennec (compiled shortly before that of Redon c. 1047-1055)20 and Sainte-Croix de Quimperlé. This latter, first compiled around 1127 and added to until the late thirteenth century, is especially valuable for showing the survival of distinct Breton customs in Cornouaille in the twelfth century whether this is with regard to naming-patterns, rents, weights or measures21. Of other surviving Breton cartularies (there are some 13 medieval ones, and five others compiled between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries)22, the majority come from areas where French was the predominant spoken language by the time they were made. Published examples include those of the female Benedictine abbeys of St-Georges de Rennes, founded c. 1030, and St-Sulpice-de-la-Forêt, founded c. 1117, both of which held their main properties in the Rennais, though St-Sulpice did acquire the priory of Locmaria at Quimper23. Of abbeys that lay closer to the linguistic frontier, original charters or cartulary copies for the twelfth and thirteenth centuries have been published for most of the major houses in the modern département of Côtes-dArmor (Beaulieu, Beauport, Bégard, Bocquen, Bon Repos, St-Aubin-des-Bois)24, though considerable unpublished material survives for some like Bégard and Beauport. The major, incompletely published, Breton cartulary is that of St-Melaine de Rennes, finished in 1344, for which there also exist a large number of original charters25. It is unfortunate that surviving evidence for monastic houses founded in Cornouaille and Léon in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries (perhaps Daoulas apart) is particularly poor26, though some priories belonging to Marmoutier or other Loire valley houses in both Haute- and Basse-Bretagne have left useful records.
4. Cathedral records
Of the nine medieval Breton cathedrals, Dol and Quimper have preserved the best collections of medieval documents made in the course of the Middle Ages. The evidence for the others is very partial before the fifteenth century. At Dol, especially from the thirteenth century, efforts were made to compile registers of deeds and other records of importance to the bishop or chapter, of which the most important surviving example is the fourteenth-century Livre rouge. This serves as an obituary book, chapter act book and cartulary, whilst another fragmentary cartulary of the fifteenth century, known as the Alanus, also survives. It contains mainly thirteenth-century material27. The most extensive cathedral cartulary extant is that of Quimper. It survives in three overlapping volumes, the first compiled in the thirteenth century, and then in a revised form in two further volumes which Bishop Alain an Gall ordered to be made in 1352, with further additions into the fifteenth century. It is especially rich for the fourteenth century but has material dating back to the eleventh28. Among known lost Breton cartularies was one for the cathedral of St-Pierre de Rennes29.
5. Early lay records
Efforts to preserve ducal or seigneurial records before the late fourteenth century is not very evident. There may have been some registration of outgoing ducal letters from the latter years of John IVs reign (1364-99) and the first inventory of ducal archives was drawn up in 1395, but the first fragmentary registers to survive come from 1404-830. Then there is a break before a virtually continuous series of registers begins early in the reign of Francis II (1458-88)31. These registers run on well into the sixteenth century. Lay cartularies are extremely rare but that compiled for the lordship of Fougères by the counts of Alençon around 1330 (known now only from later copies) is a major exception32. One for the neighbouring lordship of Vitré was compiled in the early fifteenth century33, while Prigent de Coëtivy, admiral of France (d. 1450), had an important cartulary drawn up shortly after he had acquired the great lordship of Rays by marriage34. Its earliest record is dated 1160, and it includes several early French documents. Of surviving original records from medieval seigneurial archives in the duchy, the richest but scattered collection from the standpoint of this particular paper, is that of the vicomtes de Rohan because it also incorporates much documentation deriving from the powerful families of Léon and Avaugour and thus relates chiefly to central and western Brittany in the later Middle Ages35.
6. The co-existence of Latin and the Vernacular
There are many contemporary references to the general fact that two vernacular languages were commonly spoken in the medieval duchy. Appropriate arrangements were made to provide interpreters or those with the requisite language skills according to need. It was normal to appoint Breton-speaking clerics to benefices in Bretagne-bretonnante, or to order that Francophones should learn Breton within a certain time limit or lose their livings unless they acquired papal dispensation36. As early as the reign of Salomon (857-74) it was necessary to restore to sees in Brittany bishops who spoke the same language (that is Breton) as the ruler, following a purge against Simoniacs in 84937. The last duke to speak Breton as a native was probably Alain Fergent (1084-1113/16); his successors were almost certainly monolingual French speakers38. In 1208 Pope Innocent III allowed the Cistercian abbey of Beauport to provide Breton- or English-speakers to their livings on either side of the Channel39. In the later Middle Ages, public announcements were made when necessary in both French and Breton as a document of 1326 implies40; it appears that around this time, some synodal statutes of St-Pol de Léon may have been translated into Breton, though no other evidence of them now survives41. At the inquiry at Tréguier into the sanctity of St-Yves Hélori in 1347 at least four Breton interpreters were needed to take testimonies from Bretonnants; at Angers in 1371, Alain Tardif, lector at the Franciscan convent of Angers and Even de Haya, esquire, Brittones Brittonizantes, acted in the same capacity at the inquiry into the sanctity of Duke Charles de Blois42. In 1432 Jean Malou, escripvain, was paid 20d by the chapter of Tréguier pour avoir escript la tablieu en Breton de la messe du duc43; shortly before 1440 a youth from Brest went to the Pays de Rays to learn French, where he fell victim to the notorious paedophile Gilles de Rays44; soldiers at the sieges of Fougères and Pont de lArche in 1449 and Guingamp in 1489, or those sacking the manor of LHermitage en Allineuc (22) in 1468, were reported as speaking in Breton45; other too numerous examples could be cited46. However, no medieval administrative documents now survive in Breton, if they ever did, and it is rare indeed even to find a phrase recorded in that language. An inquiry at Vannes in 1400, for instance, relates a few words spoken in Breton during a disturbance47. But this is an extremely unusual example in my experience of forty years acquaintance with Breton archives, while Jean Kerhervé confirms nous navons jamais rencontré au cours de nos dépouillements darchives le moindre document financier en breton48. Middle Breton survived essentially as a spoken rather than a written language until the late fifteenth century when the first major work to use Breton was Jean Lagadeucs trilingual dictionary (Breton, French, Latin), of which a manuscript version of 1464 is known and the first published edition was in 149949.
7. The spread of French in administrative records
What then of French? The general pattern for administrative documents in the kingdom of France was classically sketched by Giry more than a century ago. Beginning in the north-east in the very late twelfth century or early thirteenth century (examples occur at Douai in 1204, Tournai in 1206 and St-Quentin in 1218), by the 1230s the use of French had spread more widely to embrace not only northern France but also Aunis and La Rochelle (1219), Saintonge (1229) and Bas-Poitou (1230). By the mid century it was common too in Anjou, Touraine and Berry for documents concerning not only seigneurial affairs but also towns.50 Brittany fits neatly into this scheme. The first surviving letters from the royal chancery in French, issued by Louis IX in 1254, in fact concern Breton affairs51, where both the duke and some leading nobles had already been using it for some years. On 22 September 1240, for instance, an agreement between John de Dol, lord of Combour, and the Chapter of Dol over forest and other rights was recorded in French52; the partition of the vast Porhoët succession among three heiresses in 1248 was similarly recorded in that language. Two exemplars of this agreement appear to be the earliest original French documents from the duchy to survive, while the confirmation by John I on 6 February 1249 is the earliest known ducal letter in French although it only survives in a later copy53.
By the 1260s, at least in eastern Brittany, French was increasingly the language used in ducal documents relating to the nobility as by the lords themselves54. This has been seen by some commentators as deliberate policy by the dukes and their advisers to extend their control and achieve centralisation of the duchys government. This may well be the case, especially after the expansion of the ducal financial administration from the mid fourteenth century55. But before then, much of the enthusiasm or pressure for using French in Brittany derived rather from the aristocracy and their officers: in 1255 the countess of La Marches seneschal of Penthièvre was issuing letters in French56; in 1257 Raoul, vicomte du Poudouvre and his wife, did likewise when renouncing rights at Saint-Suliac-sur-Rance in favour of St-Malo de Dinan57; in 1258 and 1260 Duke John I did so when asked to confirm two baronial accords in the Nantais as he had in 1249 confirming the Porhoët agreement58, while in Bretagne-bretonnante as early as 1262 an accord between members of the Léon family was drawn up in that language at Daoulas in distant Cornouaille59. Around 1270 an inquiry by Alain de Trégaranteuc, alloué of the vicomte de Rohan, in the castellany of Corlay into whether a certain Guillaume Giquel was taillable was recorded in French60; arbitrations of noble disputes by fellow nobles were similarly delivered in French.61
8. The role of the nobility and towns in promoting use of French
It also came to be routinely used for other aspects of seigneurial life: a French epitaph occured on a now-lost tomb at the abbey of La Meilleray (44), with the date 1 May 1242 and on another dated 1250, old style62. Other early examples come from further lost noble tombs at the abbey of La Villeneuve-lès-Nantes (44), recorded by Roger de Gaignières63. A French version of a ducal Assise des pledeours of 1259 exists, though it is probably a later translation64; more convincingly an agreement by the duke to abolish aveux (1275) and the famous Assise de Rachat (1276), relating to wardships and reliefs owing on the death of noble vassals, exist in contemporary French exemplars which was their original language65. The relatively speedy acceptance of the use of French by aristocratic families in Bretagne-bretonnante in the late thirteenth century is clearly demonstrated in the Léon-Avaugour-Rohan chartrier66. By the early fourteenth century it was increasingly unusual for lords throughout the duchy to issue documents (marriage contracts, divisions of succession, delivery of dower, financial accounts67) in anything but French, an excellent illustration of Michael Clanchys comment on how written language was not usually derived directly from the speech of the majority of the people but from tradition, political authority and social status68.
Evidence for the use of French in Breton towns at this stage is limited by the very poor survival of early records, though there are indications that it was certainly used for commercial purposes in Bretagne-bretonnante. In 1280 a burgess of Hennebont was involved in an agreement concerning the Rohan family over properties around Usel and Loudéac (22)69; in 1296 when the vicomte dAvranches carried out an inquiry in the duchy on behalf of Philip IV into various acts of piracy, he apparently experienced little difficulty in interrogating witnesses in a number of coastal towns in Basse-Bretagne70. During the course of his investigation the vicomte revealed his thoroughness, if not hidden linguistic abilities, by interviewing at least one Italian and men from Bayonne. In more modern times, such towns represented islands of bilingualism in contrast to the surrounding countryside71, a state of affairs probably already evident by 1300. We also have hints at the end of the Middle Ages of social divisions later reflected in language differences with those speaking French tending to come from higher social groups, whether the aristocracy or the haute-bourgeoisie, with trilingualism most evident among the clergy and those exposed to higher learning.
9. Use of French by the dukes of Brittany and their administration
Like their nobility, the Breton ducal family recorded family matters (marriage alliances, dower arrangements) from the 1250s in French72, but the employment of French in the ducal administration was more hesitant. It was used for some diplomatic purposes in the 1260s: both John I and Duchess Blanche wrote in French to Louis IX and to Henry III of England73. From around 1270 we find Rivallan du Temple, seneschal of Nantes, writing fairly regularly in French, even to ecclesiastics74. French also came to be used in various ducal courts from this point. Many letters were issued under seals of contracts established in demesne centres or towns under ducal control; petitions and legal inquiries were also increasingly recorded in French75; similarly documents relating to the business of the Breton parlement from the late 1280s76. A list of military obligations owed to the duke by his leading vassals was famously drawn up in the Livre des Ostz, following a muster at Ploërmel in August 129477. By the early fourteenth century French was used even in ducal courts in Bretagne-bretonnante; the earliest letters issued by that at Morlaix I have found dates from 1302, Lesneven from 1310, Carhais from 1321 and St-Renan from 132978. The early fourteenth century saw several further important ducal legal documents issued in French,79 though the Très ancienne coutume of c. 1325 was an unofficial compilation put together by practising lawyers80.
The earliest ducal financial records also demonstrate the measured pace of linguistic change: the first surviving accounts come from the 1260s and 1270s and are exclusively in Latin81. There is then a gap until 1300 by which time the surviving rolls are chiefly in French, though some still contain items in Latin82. After 1308 there is an almost complete dearth of ducal financial records until the reign of John IV, by when they are almost all without exception kept in French, though occasionally Latin was used in the auditing process by the Chambre des comptes or for memoranda83. In the interim, French had also become the main language for seigneurial household or estate accounts and estate surveys84. If there was a political agenda in the ducal use of French, it must be acknowledged that this only came about slowly and had been anticipated by seigneurial usage.
10. A wider adoption of French in the later Middle Ages
How did other authorities and institutions react to the spreading use of French? The extent to which religious houses (whether older Benedictine monasteries, the important group of eleven major Breton Cistercian houses, or even the many newer mendicant foundations dating from the 1230s onwards) used French varied, and not simply as a function of their relative position to the linguistic frontier between the two halves of Brittany though this is influential in the initial spread. It is thus not surprising that in Haute-Bretagne, monastic archives show that French was used occasionally from the mid 1250s: at Bocquen from 125585, St-Malo de Dinan (1257)86, St-Aubin-des-Bois (1262)87, Geneston (1264)88, St-Sulpice (1267)89, Montonac (1272)90, Buzay (1275)91 and St-Magloire de Léhon (1278)92. But in some major cartularies from Haute-Bretagne the appearance of the first French document is relatively late: at St-Melaine de Rennes it is in 128193, at St-Sauveur de Redon (1289)94, St-Georges de Rennes (1294)95 and Notre-Dame de Jugon (1295)96. By then French is evident in some houses in Bretagne-bretonnante, most interestingly at Relecq in Haut-Léon by 128497 and Bon Repos (1289)98, though it would be the early fourteenth century before it reached Beauport (1303)99 and Bégard (1308)100 in the Trégorrois, or made its appearance in Quimpers cathedral cartulary (1321), only to be used sparingly for the rest of the century101. Indeed as late as 1489 we find the chapter of Quimper paying for a list of taxable tenants to be translated from French into Latin102. At the abbey of La Joie de Hennebont, founded by John I and his wife, French was used from 1282103 but this is less surprising since it was a nunnery drawing most of its members from an aristocratic milieu, and it has long been known that female houses favoured use of the vernacular104.
11. Which language to use ?
The erratic survival of records (most notably those relating to Bretagne-bretonnante which has lost a disproportionate number of once existing ecclesiastical documents) precludes any statistical approach to the relative use of French or Latin by religious institutions in the later Middle Ages, or of how this changed when a choice between them was acceptable105. My impression is that once established in the late thirteenth or early fourteenth century, French was regularly but not excessively used in the affairs of most houses, since Latin remained important in the administration of estates and protection of rights, and naturally for divine service and any business with the papacy. But a majority of documents emanating from the ducal chancery in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries and dealing with cathedrals, monasteries or mendicant convents, including general confirmations of privileges or more particular favours, like the licence to crenellate which John III granted in 1332 to the monks of St-Mathieu de Fineterre106, deep in Bretagne-bretonnante, were in French107. Chapter records at Vannes were being kept in French by the late fourteenth century108, so were accounts for the chapter of Tréguier in the fifteenth109. At Quimper, too, which in many respects seems to have been conservative and resistant to the spread of French110, as early as 1326, an obit for Guillaume, archdeacon of Poher, was established under the contracts seal of the town in French111. At Beauport abbey, accounts were being kept in French by 1406112. Additions in French were first added to the Necrology of Daoulas abbey in the 1440s113. Elsewhere Officialities had tentatively begun to use French from the 1250s and did so regularly by the fourteenth century114; bishops too might issue letters in French like Maurice de Trésiguidi, bishop of Rennes, who related the terms of the marriage contract between Hervé, eldest son of Hervé, vicomte de Léon, and Catherine de Laval in May 1265115.
On the other hand, parochial registers of births, marriages and deaths, precociously introduced into Brittany in the early fifteenth century by Henry Le Barbu, bishop of Nantes, previously Chancellor of the duchy116, and soon used in all other Breton dioceses, were initially kept in Latin. In the earliest still extant register, that from Roz-Landrieux, diocese of Dol, which now contains details for the period 1451-1523, only those for the years 1479-83 are recorded in French117. But other registers from Dol, Nantes and Rennes show French being used from 1462, as it was in the dioceses of St-Malo and Vannes from the early sixteenth century118. But it is only from the mid-century that it occurs in registers from St-Brieuc and Tréguier, while it is not until the early seventeenth that some in Cornouaille and St-Pol de Léon finally employed French; Latin indeed remained the language for some parish registers in Tréguier, Quimper and Léon dioceses until the late seventeenth century whereas it had all but disappeared from all other dioceses by the mid century.
12. An example of hesitant adoption : wills
Another important category of record, wills, also shows that the replacement of Latin by French was a slow and incomplete process in the later medieval period. The first full Breton noble will of which we have record is that of André de Varades in 1196119, and another informative one was made by Guillaume Le Borgne, seneschal of Goëllo in April 1220120; like most thirteenth-century Breton wills, these are in Latin, though that made on 17 June 1248 by André III, lord of Vitré, survives only in a late medieval French translation121. On the other hand, that made by Jeanne, comtesse de la Marche, dame de Fougères, containing many legacies to Breton churches, drawn up on 20 May 1269, is a French original but drafted in the Saintonge122. But even among the Breton aristocracy who were most influenced by French culture, it was rare to leave testaments in French before the mid fourteenth century123, and as late as the sixteenth century a proportion were still drawn up in Latin. But after 1400 it was unusual for any lay person to have a Latin will, even in Bretagne-bretonnante124, though clerics throughout the duchy were likely to do so into the sixteenth century. An important exception is the French will of Christophe de Penmarch, bishop of Saint-Brieuc, of 1505125.
Conclusion
Trilingual in speech, only evidence for Latin and French used for administrative purposes survives from late medieval Brittany. This brief survey has shown that after French became fashionable for various purposes in the mid thirteenth century, different chronologies of usage co-existed for differing types of record whether used by lay or ecclesiastical authorities. Social and geographical factors can be used to explain some of these differences; the influence of the high aristocracy in promoting the use of French in Brittany for certain purposes is especially clear. Some differences continued to be influenced obviously by that broad division between the spoken vernaculars of Bretagne-gallo and Bretagne-bretonnante, or even between the different varieties of Breton speech (for example, the conservatism of Cornouaille as opposed to the precocity of Léon in accepting the use of French for certain purposes)126. Other institutional developments in church and state require further consideration: for instance, the importance of the fact that until the later fourteenth century, two key administrative institutions, the ducal chancery and the Chambre des comptes, only existed in very embryonic form needs to be clearly recognized. Naturally, Latin remained very important for ecclesiastics but as this survey has shown, from a relatively early point the church was prepared to accept the use of written French and not simply for its dealings with the laity. In Bretagne-bretonnante this also inevitably meant that the majority of clerics needed to be verbally trilingual even if they did not write in Breton127; civil servants found this competence useful on occasion, especially when carrying out inquiries in Basse-Bretagne128. Comparisons and contrasts with other nearby regions where trilingualism was significant at the end of the Middle Ages (Flanders129, England130, Wales131) might be profitably pursued but not on this occasion.

Bertrand du Broussillon, La maison de Laval (1020-1605), étude historique accompagnée du cartulaire de Laval et de Vitré, Paris, 1895-1903, 5 vols. Some of the earliest documents in the cartulary of Vitré were translated into French from Latin when copied (cf. below n. 121). The same occurred when a register for the duke of Brittanys English Honour of Richmond was compiled in 1398 (see Michael Jones, « The House of Brittany and the Honour of Richmond in the late eleventh and twelfth centuries: some new charter evidence », Forschungen zur Rechts-, Papst- und Landesgeschichte, Peter Herde zum 65. Geburstag von Freunden, Schülern und Kollegen dargebracht, ed. Karl Borchardt and Enno Bünz, Stuttgart, 1998, t.

34 Cartulaire des sires de Rays, ed. René Blanchard, Poitiers, 1898-1899, 2 vols., after the original, now Archives nationales, 1 AP 1994, mid 15th c. There is one urban cartulary, that of St-Aubin-du-Cormier, compiled in the early 16th c., recording ducal charters and privileges from its foundation in 1225 (deposed at the Archives départementales Ille-et-Vilaine).
35 By the eighteenth century most of these documents were in the chartrier at the castle of Blain (Loire-Atlantique), where they were consulted by Dom Morice, historian of the house of Rohan, who published many in his Mémoires pour servir de preuves à lhistoire ecclésiastique et civile de Bretagne, Paris, 1742-1746. The chartrier was destroyed or dispersed at the Revolution, some originals being recuperated by the local savant Bizeul, from whom they passed to the Bibliothèque municipale (now Médiathèque), Nantes. Another important fonds of Rohan archives was latterly kept at the Château de Kerguehennec (Morbihan) and were used by Léon Rosenzweig in his Cartulaire du Morbihan, Vannes, 1895. Once deposited in the Archives départementales Morbihan, 20 J, these documents are currently being dispersed by sale. Other Rohan archives may be found at Archives nationales, 273 AP (see Suzanne dHuart, Archives Rohan-Bouillon, Inventaire, Paris, 1970).

Some dispensations were sought for parishes far to the east of the late medieval Loth line in the dioceses of St-Malo and Rennes; how far this is indicative of surviving pockets of Breton-speakers has not, as far as I am aware, been the subject of serious discussion, but cf.

On 14 July 1362 Pierre Poulart, knight, and his wife, Constance de Kerraoul, sealed their joint-will written in French (Dom Morice, Mémoires, t. I, col. 1454 [recte 1554]-1555). Two other early wills in French are those of Hervé du Pont, seigneur du Fresnay, and his successor Simon du Pont (Archives départementales Loire-Atlantique, H 2, n° 39-40, 24 August 1364 and 9 October 1370 respectively). That of Bertrand du Guesclin, the Breton Constable of France, was drawn up in French at the siege of Châteauneuf-du-Randon (Lozère) on 9 July 1380 (Dom Morice, Mémoires, t. II, col. 286-289); that of his successor as Constable, Olivier, lord of Clisson, on 5 February 1407, with a Latin codicil (ibid., t. II, p. 779-783).

126 Most evident in the rich evidence from the Léon-Avaugour-Rohan chartrier.
127 B.-A. Pocquet du Haut-Jussé, « La règle didiome », p. 244, cites the cases of two civil servants who were eventually promoted as bishops, Bernard du Peyron, a Gascon and client of Jeanne de Navarre, duchess of Brittany, provided first to the bishopric of Tréguier, but translated to Nantes in 1407 because of his inability to speak Breton, and of Pierre Piédru, from the Nantais, also provided initially to Tréguier but removed to St-Malo by Eugenius IV for a similar reason. Whether mendaciously or not, Robert Cador, a secretary of John V from Rennes claimed « he knew a little Breton although he did not speak it » when receiving a benefice in Bretagne-bretonnante (p. 247), and Pierre de la Haye, another ducal secretary, was provided in 1453 to the parish of Inguiniel, diocese of Vannes, despite his ignorance of Breton (p. 248).
128 Cf. J. Kerhervé, LÉtat breton, t. I, p. 38.
129 Cf. Walter Prevenier and Thérèse de Hemptinne, « La Flandre du Moyen Âge : un trilinguisme administratif » ; C. A. J. Armstrong, « The Language Question in the Low Countries : The Use of French and Dutch by the Dukes of Burgundy and their administration », Europe in the Late Middle Ages, ed. J. R. Hale et al., London, 1965, p. 386-409.
130 M. Clanchy, From Memory to Written Record, esp. Chapter 6, « Languages of Record ».
131 Llinos Beverley Smith, « The Welsh Language before 1536 », The Welsh Language before the Industrial Revolution, ed. Geraint H. Jenkins, Cardiff, 1997, p. 15-44.
132 A family surnamed Leet is found chiefly in medieval sources relating to Loire-Atlantique south of the Loire.
133 Alain VI, vicomte de Rohan (d. 1304).
134 Leet appears to have been on his way to the chapel of St-Jacques à Saint-Léon, a hamlet in the parish of Merléac (Côtes-dArmor, arr. St-Brieuc, cant. Uzel), not far from one of the Rohans favoured abbeys, Bon-Repos (Bernard Tanguy, Dictionnaire des noms de communes, trèves et paroisses des Côtes-dArmor, Douarnenez, 1992, p. 150).
135 Probably Saint-Guen (Côtes-dArmor, arr. Guingamp, cant. Mûr-de-Bretagne).
136 There was a medieval gentry family of Beaubois from Bourseul (Côtes-dArmor, arr. Dinan, cant. Plancoët).
137 Geoffroy Budes, knight, witnessed a document in May 1280 (Dom Morice, Mémoires, t. I, col. 1052); the descent of this well-known family from the time of Guillaume Budes, seigneur dUzel et de Plessis-Budes (en St-Carreuc, Côtes-dArmor, arr. St-Brieuc, cant. Moncontour), probably the Gullemet mentioned here, is traced by Père Anselme de Sainte-Marie, Histoire généalogique de la maison royale de France, t. VII, p. 523-528.
138 Plessala (Côtes-dArmor, arr. St-Brieuc, cant. Plouguenast).
139 Moncontour (Côtes-dArmor, arr. St-Brieuc, ch.-l. cant.).
140 Trébry (Côtes-dArmor, arr. St-Brieuc, cant. Moncontour).
141 Éon was possibly the lord of Les Fossés en Plélan-le-Petit (Côtes-dArmor, arr. Dinan, ch.-l. cant.); a legal dispute in 1497, when it was held by Jean de la Bouexière, traces back possession of the manor of Les Fossés four generations to a Jean Le Borgne, sire des Fossés (Archives départementales Côtes-dArmor, 32 J). This Jean des Fossés may have been an « archer desarmé » with Jean Tournemine at St-Arnoul en Yvelines on 25 November 1356 and also with Du Guesclin at Caen on 1 December 1370 and at Bourges (sic for Louviers) on 1 June 1371 (Dom Morice, Mémoires, t. I, col. 1502, 1644, 1652).
142 Plérin (Côtes-dArmor, arr. St-Brieuc, cant. St-Brieuc-Nord).

"Though why anyone would want to play during an air raid is open to question." Don't know many golfers, eh? They're pretty hard-core. The ones here in South Carolina brave alligators on the fairways without a second thought. They just play around.

Peacetime losses
When I was playing the US the first time I used the structural failure and loss of a destroyer as a catalyst for a new building program, finally pushing it through Congress after years of foot dragging. And then, of course, you had the Philippines. BOOM!

I have made a terrible mistake
You know what must really suck? Actually being a member of an African royal family and needing to get a large sum of money out of the country. And if someone does believe you, they're probably in the 70's or 80's and have little clue how the internet works, much less international banking.

Russian "Mine battleship"
Interesting. I guess the US Navy wasn't the only one to investigate the idea of torpedo battleships. Granted, with all those tubes I'd have grave doubts about her watertight integrity if she gets hit by one.

USN Ships for 1942
Those twin enclosed 5" mounts are going to be MUCH heavier than the old singles, and I think you have them simmed wrong. I've always counted them as mount & hoist and they also have armored gunhouses.

Been fun, but I'm done.
I have nothing to offer the sim any more and no real interest at all so I'm done. Don't really have much in the way of story advice to give to any future US player, though I do have production reports through 1941 pretty much done. Since my mother died last fall I've lost all interest in the sim and all its twists and turns and general shenanigans. All the emphasis on economics and other non-naval minutia just makes my eyes roll back and I start drooling like an idiot. Its just not fun anymore, ...

Iowa Class Battleship Design as Basis for Ocean Liners
With my Columbia and Liberty I used the engines from unfinished Lexington class Battlecruisers, but that was about it. The rest of the hull was purpose built. The S.S. United States' power plant apparently was used as the prototype for the plant used in the Forrestal, so I don't see why the Iowa's engines wouldn't work in a liner.

ENCOMPASS CHAMPIONSHIP: Stadlers a surprise leader entering final round
ENCOMPASS CHAMPIONSHIP: Stadlers a surprise leader entering final round
Who would have expected Craig Stadler to be the 36-hole leader of the Encompass Championship?
Well, certainly not Craig Stadler.
The veteran long ago nicknamed the Walrus hasnt won a tournament since 2004 and hasnt even been in contention in one since 2007. Three months ago he was on the brink of ending his long career as a touring pro. On Sunday, though, he will take a two-stroke lead into the final round of the $1.8 million Encompass Championship  the new Champions Tour event being conducted at North Shore Country Club in Glenview.
Finishing with darkness setting in on Friday, Stadler overcame a 3-hour 28-minute rain delay to post a 67, good enough for a share of the first round lead. He followed that with a scorching 65 on Saturday, a round in which he holed a 40-foot bunker shot en route to a 32 on the back nine.
Another usual back-in-the-pack player, Bob Tway, matched Stadlers 65 and Hinsdales Jeff Sluman strung four birdies on the back nine en route to shooting a 66. They are two strokes shy of Stadlers 12-under-par 132 total going into the final 18.
Stadler, the 1982 Masters champion, appears a man on a mission.
(Golf) hasnt been fun in a long time, he said. Well see what happens tomorrow, but its fun to make putts  and Ive made a boatload of putts.
So what caused the sudden transformation? Sessions with swing guru Billy Harmon certainly helped. A desperate Stadler went to see him in Palm Springs, Calif.
I walked out on the back range and Billys standing there, recounted Stadler. He said, `What are we doing? I said `Youve got two days to either fix it or Im done, very simple. He looked at me and said `Lets go!
And off they went. Stadler doesnt think his game has been completely fixed yet, but quitting isnt a consideration any more.
Shooting in the 60s is a lot better than shooting 78s and 82s and 76s and 79s, which is what Ive been shooting off and on for the last four-five years, he said. It got to the point, one, it was no fun, and two, it was getting to be embarrassing.
Tways 65 was a bit more spectacular than Stadlers  at least at the end. He shot 6-under 30 on the back side and on the last eight holes he went eagle-par-par-birdie-birdie-birdie-par-birdie. The sizzling stretch ended when a 30-foot putt dropped.
Like Stadler, Tway  best known for holing a bunker shot on the last hole to take the 1986 PGA title from Greg Norman  was having his own frustrations before arriving at North Shore. They mirrored what Stadler has been going through.
My game has not been what it should be, he said. Today was better. There has been some frustration, but Im a whole lot more mellow now than I was when I was on the other (PGA) Tour.
Both Stadler and Tway won a major title in their PGA Tour days and both have sons named Kevin who are touring pros. Kevin Stadler in on the PGA Tour and Kevin Tway, the 2005 U.S. Junior Amateur champion, is playing on the Web.com circuit.
Stadler and Tway both are big fans of North Shore, an old-style course that some of the current Champions Tour players last tested in the 1983 U.S. Amateur.
That shows how old we are, but we love it, said Tway. When everyone found out we were going to get to come here we were all excited. The course is in unbelievable shape.
Its probably got the best fairways Ive seen ever, said Stadler. I played here a couple times when I was in college way back when. I absolutely love it.
Sluman, a leader in getting the Champions Tour back for the first time since 2002, made eight birdies while playing in the last group of the day with retired Bear Brian Urlacher. Urlacher chipped in twice, which was more eye-catching that Slumans steadiness.
Just a good solid round, and I kept myself out of trouble, said Sluman. We just felt it was long overdue to get an event back in Chicago. Were excited to be here.
The duel for the $270,00 first prize, to be awarded after Sundays final round, figures to be a tight one but the tournament within the tournament  the two-man pro-am team event that ended on Saturday  certainly wasnt. The duo of pro Steve Pate and amateur Lee Tenzer posted a 25-under-par score for 36 holes and won by five shots.

Contemporary Connections
What can I do to be an active, responsible and effective citizen in my community? Consider how you can take action in your own communities. This section will explore the contemporary connections we can make between Rosss visual record and the roles of photography, art and social media can play as tools for social justice today. As we learn about the different ways people engage in social justice issues now, we ask you to think about what it means to be a witness. What responsibilities do we have to take action as both creators and receivers of information about social injustices? How can we act based on the information we receive? Use the answers to these questions to explore how action in your own communities could help spark positive change.

Learning Strategies
Using the websites below, explore the ways in which photography, art and social media are used to take action on issues of social injustice and advocate for change. Ask students to record the ways in which each organization is documenting injustice and/or atrocities. What are the tools that each organization uses to bring attention to these issues?
Photographers and Social Justice
PhotoSensitive is a non-profit collective whose projects focus on North American issues, including poverty, hunger, illness, racism, ignorance and injustice. But the collective also focuses on the antidotes to these problems: the hope found in the face of adversity, the laughter and love that make the difficulties of life tolerable, and the simple pleasures that lighten dark lives. PhotoSensitive's photographers use the camera to tell stories, make social comments and spur viewers to action.

Using Social Media - The Sentinel Project
While governments with the power to stop genocide and save lives have stood by and done nothing in the past, civil society - ordinary people and non-governmental organizations - can still make a difference. Since genocide can be prevented by acting before it begins, the Sentinel Project is working to make this pre-emptive action possible through the creation of an early-warning system and cooperation with threatened communities and other anti-genocide organizations.
https://thesentinelproject.org/
Read the interview with Chris Tuckwood of the Sentinel Project and identify the challenges and triumphs that he and his organization have experienced. What tools did Tuckwood use to overcome the obstacles he faced and begin to create change?
Creating a Toolbox for Change
Studying difficult histories can be challenging, as students can feel overwhelmed and powerless in the face of injustice. It is important that students are taken safely in and out of these experiences with the knowledge that their choices matter and they have the ability to take action to create change. A great way to start thinking about this process is by creating a Toolbox for Change. The types of tools that each of us requires will vary depending on individual needs and the issue at hand. For example, I might put a coin in my toolbox to represent the fact that I need funding to run a successful project. Alternatively, I might put a drawing of a heart in my toolbox to show that I need to empathize with and strive to understand others in order to create meaningful change. The possibility for different types of tools is endless; this will demonstrate that there are many ways to create change.
Ask students to consider all the tools that have been used by the different individuals and organizations. Then ask them to consider an issue they are passionate about and think about what tools they need to create change. Hand out sticky notes to all students and have them each write down one tool for their Toolbox for Change. Students should come up one by one and post their sticky notes on the wall. As they post their notes on the wall, students may briefly describe the tools they selected and why they selected them.
Discussion
All over the world, individuals are documenting issues that their communities are facing. We encounter this documentation in many different places: on Facebook, through Twitter, on Instagram, on TV, in newspapers, in books, in theatre and in visual art. As witnesses or recipients of this information, what is our responsibility to act, and what can we do once we have this information?

Interview
Chris Tuckwood, Executive Director of the Sentinel Project.
February 27, 2015
How would you describe the goals or mandate of the Sentinel Project?
Our mission is to assist communities threatened by mass atrocities around the world. There are two important pillars to this mission. First, we emphasize working on the ground, cooperating with the people in harm's way. Second, we use innovative technology to achieve our mission whenever possible.
What inspired you to start the Sentinel Project?
I was 16 years old when I first learned about the Rwandan genocide from a documentary on television. Something about it really resonated with me and I decided to devote my life to stopping things like that from happening again. Of course, I didn't know how to achieve that when I first started out, but I educated myself a lot about genocide. When I got to university, I had an opportunity to become a student leader in the movement to stop the genocide in Darfur. We were very successful on our own campus, but I wanted to have a more direct way of helping people in danger on the other side of the world. That's where the idea of predicting and preventing atrocities using the modern tools available to us started and grew into the Sentinel Project.
In the work that you do, what resources or tools have you found to be the most helpful?
Definitely people  and I'm not just saying that because it sounds like a good thing to say. If I go back to the two pillars of our mission that I mentioned earlier, they are both really important, but that community cooperation on the ground with people whose lives are threatened really makes our mission happen. There are lots of cool things we use, like drones, satellite imagery and networks of people gathering information with mobile phones. But those technologies are tools, and if there's nobody to use them, we're not going to succeed. Technology enables us to do most things more effectively, but at the end of the day, it's people who save lives, whether they're our volunteers here in Toronto, our staff on the ground, or community members working with us to prevent atrocities.
What obstacles and challenges have you faced? Think of one you were able to overcome and describe how you succeeded in overcoming it.
The biggest obstacle we've faced in our history so far has definitely been related to finding funding for our work. The fact is that people make things happen, but money helps them do that in a big way. We really struggled with this early on, since we started the organization from nothing and had basically no money. Ultimately, solving that problem came down to a few different things: persistence, catching people's attention with our important work and taking some risks. If we had quit early on, we wouldn't be where we are now, doing this important work. At the same time, if a few of us hadn't been willing to take the leap and invest our own personal money to fund some of our first fieldwork in Kenya, then we would never have caught the attention of funders to do really impactful work in the field. It all came down those three things: persistence, an important cause and taking a risk.
Describe the process or steps you went through to develop a particular project and see it through to a successful conclusion.
The fieldwork I just mentioned is the best example, since Kenya (where I'm travelling to as I write this) is home to our flagship Una Hakika project right now. A couple of years ago, there were a series of interethnic massacres in a part of Kenya called the Tana Delta, where violence like this is common. It got a little bit of attention in the international media, but we wanted to see behind the headlines and learn about how and why it happened. That's when a couple of us booked flights to Kenya, rented a car and drove out to the conflict zone to talk to people and learn from them. We didn't go in with any solutions in mind; we really just wanted to better understand the problem and then see what we could do.
Ultimately, this inspired the idea for Una Hakika, which is a mobile phonebased information service that monitors and counters the spread of incendiary rumours that contribute to the atmosphere of fear, distrust and hatred in the Tana Delta. Now, when people there hear a rumour that another ethnic group is planning to attack them, they can use a reliable source of information to investigate it for them rather than reacting right away. They can ask Una hakika?  Are you sure? in Swahili  and come to us. The project is at an early stage but has been really successful so far and we have big plans for it throughout Kenya and even in other countries.
That process we followed in the Tana Delta has served us well: recognizing a crisis and going to gather information with open minds rather than having preconceived notions and bringing in outside solutions that might not fix the problem. Now we do the same thing everywhere we operate  it's an essential part of that community cooperation that we emphasize.
What do you think would be a good first step for someone in high school who wants to make a difference?
When you're young, it can seem daunting to be faced with a big problem that you want to solve, especially if it's one with global importance. However, the fact is that those problems seem daunting at any age, so it's never too early to start doing something. Lots of impressive things are achieved by people both young and old. And doing something also doesn't mean you have to run out and start an organization right away  though, if you want to do that, then go for it, because ambition goes a long way.
The first step, no matter what, should be self-education about whatever issue it is that you care about. Starting with self-education about genocide when I was high school meant that by the time I got to university and then out into the so-called real world, I already had a lot of expertise on the topic and was confident and comfortable taking a leadership role and talking about it with anyone. Self-education also reinforces the fact that learning does not begin and end with the classroom. Gaining knowledge is within your power, and if self-education is the first step in making the difference you want, it's going to help you figure out all the steps after that.

Drone Video Company Produces Music Video for RAJITHEONE
MINNEAPOLIS, MN - 05/14/2018  Twin Cities recording artist RAJITHEONE on Friday debuted his newest music video, which was shot almost exclusively with drones.
Approximately 80 percent of the video for RAJITHEONEs latest single My Word was filmed with drones by Minneapolis-based AirVuz. Drones with lights attached were also used for illumination in the video, meaning about 95 percent of all shots in the video incorporated drones.
Its the first-ever music video produced by AirVuz, the worlds leading drone video and photography sharing platform. The team of certified AirVuz pilots used the DJI Inspire 2 with the Zenmuse X7 camera, as well as the DJI Phantom 4 Professional, for all of the drone shots. The 50mm lens on the X7 allowed for close-ups of Raji throughout the filming of the video.
RAJITHEONE broke onto the scene with his song #WhiteGirlVoice from the 2017 album Sincerely¨theBuzzisReal. The song has more than 16 million plays on Spotify. RAJITHEONE has also worked with names like Big Sean and Trey Songz in his music career.
For more information, contact Tyler Mason, Director of Public Relations, at tyler@airvuz.com.

Drive for Show
On August 16, 2016 in General by Megan Thompson
Drive for Show
By Tim Mahoney
The phrase Drive for show and putt for dough has been apart of the game of golf since the early Scotts started hitting rocks into the rabbit holes, as they tended to there sheep. Consistent putters always finish around the top of the leader board and are the lower handicap players at our clubs. But, also keep in mind that golfers who miss fairways never get to the green to attempt a putt. Putting attributes to approximately 42% of total strokes and woods 23%, but we must get the ball into play, in order to advance towards the putting surface. Consistent drivers have the following fundamentals:
1. A mind-set of conservative off of the tee and aggressive around the greens. Get the ball somewhere in the fairway. Corners and doglegs are not meant to be carried, they are meant to play around. If you cant find the fairway with your driver use your 3-wood, if you cant find it with your 3-wood use your 5 and so on.
2. Thirteen clubs 1 swing. If you were to ask any consistent player they would tee you, I have 1 swing, but I have 13 different set-ups. A waist high to waist high swing is always at right angles to the positioning of your spine. At address the club is positioned at right angles to your spine. As the clubs get longer or shorter your posture will be affected, longer clubs, wider stance and less bend at address, shorter clubs narrow stance and more bend. The change in spine tilt will affect the plane or angle of the swing. The club is always swung around your spine, with the spine as the hub.
3. Distance=Swing speed+ solid contact. Speed is the result of utilizing all power sources (body, arms and wrist) during a balance motion. Solid contact is the result of a proper swing shape as you maintain the hub (spine.)
4. Utilize friendly and conforming equipment. Longer shafts, larger club heads, lower center of gravity and distance balls will assist with distance and direction control. Overly stiff shafts and lower lofted clubs make driving much more difficult.
Lower scores and consistency is the result of fairways hit, greens in regulation, consistent wedge play and distance control in putting. Consistency starts with fairways hit. The average tour player hits 9.5 fairways per round, the fairways they miss the ball is on the property. Controlled driving means lower scores. The old Scotts had wide pastures and short holes.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 11, 2018
RESOURCES FOR HURRICANE FLORENCE
CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA -Hurricane Florence is expected to make landfall in the southeast in the coming days. It is too early to know the precise track the system will take, but it is expected that Central Virginia will receive significant rainfall through the weekend, and flooding and heavy winds are expected. County, City, regional, and state partners are working together to prepare for this event.
Please take a few moments to review information below and create a plan to prepare for the storm. To stay up-to-date on emergency alerts, register for CodeRED, like CommEmerg on Facebook, and follow @CommEmerg on Twitter.

Prepare
Create an emergency kit so you can shelter-in-place safely and comfortably. Please remember your four-legged friends!
Property owners and property managers can reduce the possibility of flooding by keeping all conveyances clear of debris and other obstructions. Remove debris from stormwater grates, inlets, the upstream ends of open pipes and culverts, and the outfall structures of detention basins and ponds.
Remove fallen tree limbs and other debris from channels upstream of pipes so this material doesnt wash downstream and clog the pipes.
For the latest weather information: https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/#Florence
Stay Safe
Turn Around, Dont Drown! Do not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters. Each year, more deaths occur due to flooding than from any other thunderstorm related hazard. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that over half of all flood-related drownings occur when a vehicle is driven into hazardous flood water.
In the event of high winds, take shelter in a storm shelter or an interior room, away from windows.
Only use generators outdoors and away from windows.
Listen for emergency information and alerts.
Evacuate if told to do so.

County staff have been preparing for the anticipated heavy rains associated with Hurricane Florence  in part  by removing trash and debris from public stormwater conveyances, including outfall structures at dams and stormwater management facilities.Please take a moment to look at any stormwater structures on your property  drains, ditches, etc.  and remove any debris that may be blocking them.

Supplier: Turtle Pack
More Turtle Pack details
The Turtle Pack was inspired by entrepreneur Michael Harkins own experiences as a swimming teacher
Entrepreneur Michael Harkins has developed a new swimming aid that is designed to make learning to swim easier and more accessible for children between the ages of three and six.
Turtle Pack is a patent pending flotation device that consists of a neoprene vest and a set of three stacked EVA foam shells that decrease in size. The multifunctional shells, which can also be used as floats and pool tools, are removed as the child gets more confident in the water.
The vest is designed to free up the user's arms, enabling them to learn the correct strokes, whilst the backpack-like setup ensures that they maintain the correct body position in the water.
"Turtle Pack has been designed to promote correct technique but also ensure that swimming is a fun experience for kids. If we can make swimming safe, fun and efficient then everyone wins," said Harkins.
The idea for Turtle Pack really came from my own experiences as a swimming instructor. I could see that when kids were getting frustrated or not making progress this often translated into them not wanting to continue their lessons," Harkins continues.
Supplier: Turtle Pack
Turtle Pack® is a fun swimming aid designed to make learning to swim faster, more effective and more enjoyable.

Ten Tips for Comparing Health Care Policies
By Admin / September 25, 2017
Australians already know that health coverage can provide security for individuals and families when a medical need arises. Many, however, do not know how to find the best value when comparing health insurance policies.
Below are 10 tips everyone should read before shopping for private health coverage.
1. Choose coverage that concentrates on your specific health needs, or potential health needs.
The first thing you should do before comparing your health plan options is determine which policy features best fit your needs. A 30-year-old accountant, for instance, is going to need very different coverage than a 55year-old pro golfer, or a 75-year-old retired veterinarian. By understanding the health needs that most often correspond to people in your age and activity level group  your life stage  you can save money by purchasing only the coverage you need and avoid unnecessary services that arent relevant. For instance, a young family with two small children isnt going to need coverage for joint replacement or cataract surgery. A 60-year-old school teacher isnt going to need pregnancy and birth control-related services.
Whether its high level comprehensive care youre after, or the least expensive option to exempt you from the Medical Levy Surcharge while providing basic care coverage, always make sure youre comparing health insurance policies with only those services that make sense for you and your family.
2. Consider options such as Excess or Co-payment to reduce your premium costs.
When you agree to pay for a specified out-of-pocket amount in the event you are hospitalized, you sign an Excess or Co-payment option that will reduce your health insurance premium.
If you choose the Excess option, you agree to pay a predetermined, specific amount when you go to hospital, no matter how long your stay lasts. With a Co-payment option, you agree to pay a daily sum up to a pre-agreed amount. For example, if Joanne has an Excess of $250 on her medical coverage policy and is admitted to hospital, regardless of how long her stay turns out to be, she will pay $250 of the final bill. If Andrew has signed a $75×4 Co-payment with his provider, he will pay $75 per day for just the first the first four days of his hospitalization.
For younger individuals who are healthy and fit with no reason to expect to land in hospital any time soon, either of these options are great ways to reduce the monthly cost of your medical insurance premiums.
Keep in mind that different private insurers have their own rules when it comes to Excess and Co-payments, including how many payments you will need to make annually on either option. It is important to read the policy thoroughly and ask questions in advance in order to have a clear understanding of what you are paying for, and what you can expect coverage-wise in the event that you are hospitalized. Also, make sure you choose an Excess option greater than $500 if youre purchasing an individual policy, or $1, 000 for family coverage, in order to be exempted from the Medicare Levy Surcharge.
3. Pay your health insurance premium in advance before the cost increases.
Each year insurance providers increase their premiums by approximately five percent sometime around the first of April, a practice approved by the Minister of Health. By instituting these annual increases, your health insurance provider retains the ability to fulfill their obligations to policyholders despite increasing medical costs.
Most private medical policy providers allow policy holders to pay for one years premium in advance, which locks them into the previous years rate for an additional 12 months  a great way to save money. In order to take advantage of the savings offered, most insurers require payment in full be made within the first quarter of the year, between January and March.
4. Lock in to low cost health insurance at an early age.
The most obvious advantage any Australian can take when it comes to saving money on your insurance premiums is to buy in early to the least expensive rate available. And by early, we mean before age 31. Everyone who is eligible for Medicare will receive at least a 30 percent rebate from the government on the price of their health care premium, no matter what age you are. However, by purchasing hospital coverage before the July first following your 31st birthday, you can be ensured the lowest premium rate available.
After age 31, your health insurance rate is subjected to a two percent penalty rate increase for every year after age 30 that you did not have health insurance. Therefore, if you wait to purchase private health coverage until youre age 35, you will pay 10 percent more annually than you would have if you had purchased it at age 30.

The Three S's In Shooting by NBA Coach Barry Hecker
The Three S's In Shooting by NBA Coach Barry Hecker
Posted by Former NBA Coach Barry Hecker on January 12, 2014
As an assistant to coach Bill Fitch, I have had the opportunity to learn many of the fundamentals of the game, with special emphasis on the shooting skills and footwork.
It is interesting to note that whenever a player goes up to the foul line, he will invariably go through a pre-shot routine in which he will place his shooting hand on the ball with the fingertips perpendicular to the seams.
The ball, when held in this position, will usually rotate (spin) in a straight arc to the basket. My question is this: Why do so many of the players who shoot properly from the foul line change their technique when they shoot from the field?
"S" For Spin
Take an outstanding player like Terry Dehere. At Seton Hall, he set the all-time scoring record for the Big East, although he shot the ball with a side spin. Upon his arrival in Los Angeles, we suggested that he change his shooting technique. With hard work, repetition, and concentration on the correct technique, Terry began shooting a ball that spun straight and true - raising his shooting percentage from 29.4% to 44.0% from the three-point arc and 40.7% to 49.0% from the field. The over spin gave his shot the so-called "shooter's bounce" - a shot that hits the front of the rim and drops into the basket, thanks to the proper rotation on the ball.
Brent Barry, a rookie last season, is another player who improved his shooting by making a daily practice habit of "seaming it". Watch some of the great shooters in the NBA, such as Reggie Miller, Mark Price, Jeff Hornacek, Hersey Hawkins, and Chris Mullin. All have good rotation because they shoot with the seams.
"S" For Stop
Another aspect of shooting that has to be addressed is what I call "stopping and tempo." Every good NBA shooter is aware of the importance of good technique. But, though they may work hard on their hands and arms, they will often neglect their feet, and it can hurt their shooting technique. In order to square up with the target, the shooter must be able to come to a quick stop with his feet correctly spaced. That will create a base from which to launch the shot. (Remember, the shot starts from the ground up.)
The feet should be set preferably shoulder-width apart and slightly staggered, depending on the hand with which the shot is taken. Michael Jordan has an uncanny ability to stop on balance and go right into the shot, with his shoulders square to the basket. Every shooter in the game should take the time to study Michael's footwork. The farther the shooter is from the basket, the more centered his balance and tempo must be. The shooter must not only establish a proper base, but should shoot with a consistent tempo.
How many times have you seen a player shoot too quickly? This is invariably caused by lifting and releasing the ball too quickly, thus failing to give the body time to maintain balance and to shoot with a steady tempo. The best analogy I can make is a golfer who takes his club back too fast and thus fails to give his body the time to balance up and swing the club properly on the downswing. What he does, in essence, is fail to create the tempo and balance. In raising or lifting the basketball, it is essential to keep the arms close to the body - never extend them too far from the body.
The extended position will create a weak shooting position, poor balance, and an inconsistent tempo. You can compare this lifting of the ball to the motion of a military press in weight lifting. You must keep the bar close to the mid-line of the body. If you move it too far away, you are going to lose control, balance, and strength. The same thing happens in shooting. You must raise the ball in a steady, rhythmic motion. Observe a Chris Mullin, Steve Kerr, Reggie Miller, Or Dennis Scott. Their feet are invariably set and their delivery totally fluid. Plus, they all shoot with the seams.
"S" For Sight
The final area of shooting that requires study is the eyes. Watch an NBA or college game, and observe the shooter's eyes at the foul line. One player will sight in on the target or rim, while another will wrongly follow the flight of the ball. Balance is an integral aspect of shooting and it will become difficult to maintain if you watch the flight of the ball. If, as you release, they ball, you follow it with your eyes, you will invariably cause your head to lift, move back or do both.
That will cause the body weight or balance to transfer back, and you will end up with your weight on the back of your heels. Result: a low elbow release that will often product a shot that will hit the front rim (short). Since the low elbow is difficult to lift up, the shooting tempo will also be affected. An analogy may be drawn to shooting a gun. You must sight in and keep your eyes on the target and head still as you squeeze the trigger. Study your shooters and see if they have any problems with the seams, stop and tempo, or the eyes areas.
One of the most satisfying and gratifying coaching moments lies in instructing a player on a certain technique and then watching him or her execute it perfectly with the game on the line!

In this first cottage we wanted to create the sense of a contemporary space whilst retaining traditional features of the original building.
Leather, fireside chairs are for sinking into; original timbers have become a feature wall in the bedroom, and there is ample space for washing and drying outdoor gear.
INTERIOR
The cottages spacious interior lends well to our open-plan layout: kitchen, living and dining areas are all integrated without compromising on space. And whatever you may be doing - from making tea to planning tomorrows walk  the views across Glen Garry are compelling in all weathers. French doors leading to a decking area invite breakfast, lunch and evening drinks to be taken outside in contemplation of the views.
For the colder nights an easily managed wood-burning stove, along with plentiful wood and coal is at your disposal. There is central heating throughout this very well insulated cottage making it a cosy and comfortable retreat. In addition to the stylish bathroom with electric shower, the cowshed has a fully kitted out utility room with washing machine and tumbler dryer.

Comfortable super king-size bed, which can also be made up as two full-size twin beds

Steve and Kirsty, and their absolute desire to welcome and help you enjoy your holidays at Lettoch
Sorry but we do not allow dogs
We're very sorry but the Cow Sheds are strictly for 2 adults only and not suitable for children under the age of 14.
The best we have stayed in. Superb cottage.	
A perfect weeks stay at The Cow Shed, a real home-from-home.	
The Cow Shed is a revelation and the work that Steve & Kirsty (not forgetting Steves Dad) have put into the renovation has created superb accommodation.	
So many interesting visitor attractions in the area. Beautiful walks, great choice of eateries. We will be back.

Gatlinburg, Tennessee: Family-Friendly
Fun for All Seasons
Whether you want to view absolutely gorgeous scenery, ski one of the most popular resorts in the country or discover a family-friendly vacation spot the whole gang can enjoy, Gatlinburg answers the call.
Nestled in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, is an easy destination from nearly any direction. It's only a day's drive from two-thirds of the population east of the Mississippi.
Tennessee's most popular stops  including Nashville, the country-music capital; and Pigeon Forge, home of Dollywood  are also within a short drive from Gatlinburg, but this city of only 4,000 residents packs a lot of attraction itself.

Getting There
Gatlinburg is conveniently situated within and close to several major highways including US-321 from Nashville, I-75 from Lexington and points north, US-441 from Atlanta and I-40 from Atlanta. Coming from Atlanta, you can take I-40 to US-321 (a good alternate route). Take exit 407 on I-40. Gatlinburg is also served by the McGhee Tyson Airport in Knoxville.
Ride the Gatlinburg Trolleys all day for $2, or find lots of free and pay parking scattered around the city.

What to Pack
The climate in Tennessee's Smoky Mountain region leans toward the comfortably temperate all year long. Summer highs could climb into the mid-80s Fahrenheit, but winter lows rarely dip below the freezing mark and could reach as high as the 50s  a great break from the bitter cold for visitors from the north.
Comfortable, moisture-wicking layers are your best bet. Whether you're watching the leaves turn in fall or hiking the Smoky Mountains National Park in spring, a light jacket is likely the most you'll need three seasons of the year. Wear supportive walking shoes for city treks and hiking boots on the trails. Rainfall is at its peak during late spring and early summer, so if you're making your way to Gatlinburg for vacation, pack your umbrella.

Gatlinburg Attractions
There's plenty to see and do in Gatlinburg, but you need only glance out the window and upward to realize the biggest attraction of all. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park virtually envelops the town, and you can take in the mountain range's amazing scope and beauty all year round.
Strap on your hiking boots and join an experienced guide  or blaze your own path  through miles of wooded trails that bring you close to nature in a way you never thought possible. No trip to the Smokies is complete without a look at inspiring waterfalls. Walk right up to (and behind) the Grotto Falls off Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail, or aim your camera at the 80-foot cascade of Laurel Falls, the most-photographed spot in the Smokies; arrive early in the morning or visit in the off-season to avoid the crowds.
If mountain vistas spark your imagination, take a trek to Chimney Tops or Mt. LeConte. Both of these routes can be steep or rugged, so less-experienced hikers may opt for an easy trail to earn their "land legs." If that's the case, Cave Code Loop Road is a level, leisurely hike that takes you through a wildlife area where you might well spy black bear, coyote, wild turkey and more.
But hikes aren't the only attraction in Gatlinburg  you can also go mountain biking, ziplining, horseback riding and skiing on some of the best slopes in the south. Back in town, the landmarks include family-friendly museums and an aerial tramway that gives you a bird's-eye view of the Smokies.

Festivals & Events
Gatlinburg proudly claims the title of "first 4th of July parade." It starts promptly at midnight on Independence Day, which makes for a unique parade-watching experience! A calendar's worth of festivals and events includes Gatlinburg Winter Magic, a fine arts festival and Smoky Mountain Tunes & Tales.
[Back to top]
Lodging
From bed-and-breakfasts to hotels and motels, Gatlinburg delivers suitable places to stay for any visitor. You'll find a range of hotels aimed toward affordability with clean, comfortable and modest accommodations, while the town's more upscale choices offer amenities like in-room fireplaces and mountain views.
The Smoky Mountains National Park has a range of campsites occupying backcountry (in park-provided shelters), frontcountry (tents, pop-up trailers and RVs) and equestrian trails.
View Gatlinburg Hotels, Motels, B&B, Cabins and Condos.
[Back to top]
Dining and Entertainment
The town of Gatlinburg embraces its Appalachian heritage, and that extends to the southern-style home cooking. While you can certainly find lighter fare, breakfasts typically feature hearty southern favorites including pancakes, biscuits & gravy, eggs, sausage and more to get you on your way. You absolutely cannot leave town without trying the region's famous barbecued ribs. You can also find local seafood like crawfish and catfish, vegetarian choices and much more.
In fact, just about every taste gets its due in Gatlinburg; from pizza parlors to sushi bars, you can likely find something to please your palate.
Get a nap in after a day on the trails  you'll want your batteries recharged in time to enjoy Gatlinburg nightlife. Adults can find dinner theater, comedy clubs and karaoke in the downtown district. Kid-ready entertainment includes a wild-and-crazy virtual-reality movie simulator and gaming centers where skill and luck win big prizes.
Gatlinburg is a family-friendly town for all seasons. Come visit today!

The Albuquerque Lifestyle  Too Vibrant to Be Kept Indoors!
The Albuquerque Lifestyle  Too Vibrant to Be Kept Indoors!
In all likelihood, before the ink is even dry on the lease to your new Albuquerque apartment, youll hear people around town talking about Duke City. This is just one example of how proud the people are of their history!
When Spanish colonists arrived here in the early 1700s, they loved it so much that they decided to make it a permanent settlement. So, they wrote a letter to Spains Duke of Albeurquerque seeking his blessing. In return, they named the new settlement after him. Yes, the spelling has changed over the years, but the Dukes influence still remains!
Here are 3 other tidbits that will give you a taste of the Albuquerque lifestyle:
1. Outdoor recreation is big here
In addition to having a variety of mountains, rivers, lakes, and deserts, Albuquerque is also home to four distinct seasons. As a result, no matter what you like to get out and do, you can do it here! Youll see people doing everything from running, to biking, to hiking, to skiing, to snowboarding. There are also a number of popular campgrounds where you can get up close with nature. This is also a golfers paradise, as there are four public golf courses that are open from dawn to dusk 364 days each year.
You can even take Fido with you while you explore the great outdoors. Albuquerque is very dog-friendly, with more than a dozen dog parks scattered around the city.
2. The growth isnt just inside the city limits
Albuquerque has a few natural barriers that prevent it from developing too far from the center of town  like the Sandia Mountains to the east, Kirtland Air Force Base to the south, and the Sandia Pueblo reservation to the north. However, a number of thriving suburbs have popped up, most of which sit to the west of Albuquerques city limits. The cost of living tends to be a bit cheaper in these suburbs, so if youre looking for an apartment on a very limited budget, you may want to expand your search outside of Albuquerque itself.
3. Your side of town will determine the culture you experience
Some of the most vibrant nightlife and history can be found in Downtown Albuquerque, but if youre looking for a neighborhood thats very quiet, youll love the rural feel in the South Valley. Nob Hill, which sits just to the east of Downtown and the University of New Mexico, is the chicest part of town. If you like living amongst high-end restaurants and trendy boutiques, youll want an apartment here.
Bottom line  you can choose the exact lifestyle you want simply by narrowing down your apartment search!

NEW LOOK COMING FOR WORLDWIDE COMICS
In early January we will launch a new look for our web-site with improved search functions, a want list capability for clients and a new color scheme with design on the site. We are feverishly fine tuning it now and are very anxious to get it completed. This will mark the first major change to our site since we launched it in 2008.
NEW COLLECTIONS
It is the end of 2013 and we are happy to report that we have purchased four collections of late Silver Age to late Bronze Age Marvel and DC comics in high grade this fall. For the past three months we have been processing these books as fast as we can but are not even half way through the collections. To date, over 1000 have gone to CGC for grading and we have put up over 4,000 non-CGC on the site at this point. The first 200 have returned from CGC in late November and you can see those in the New Arrivals section being uploaded daily.
Golden/Atomic Age Comics
Although it has become near impossible to find Golden Age collections in today's market, we are constantly acquiring great Golden Age and 1950's comics to stock on our web-site every month, so for those collectors, keep an eye on the new arrivals as we are uploading over 100 new issues each week.

Bakoven
Bakoven possibly a name of Dutch origin, after the pizza-oven shaped hole in a large rock in the bay. It is a small haven of calm at the edge of Camps Bay. While not sacrificing any of the views, proximity to the sea or luxury of lifestyle, you are not in the midst of the cosmopolitan center of Camps Bay, thus affording you a quieter, more laid back holiday experience.
Bakoven has its own pebbly beach and several amazing and secluded spots suited for sundowners, which afford you the opportunity to get out of the wind too.
The Camps Bay Strip is only 15 minutes walk (5 minutes drive) away, which means you're close to the action, but not in the thick of it.
1 blog post for this area.
Bantry Bay
Nestled against the slopes of the iconic Lions Head peak, Bantry Bay boasts magnificent views, complete exclusivity and the benefit of being largely wind still throughout most of the year.
The accommodation here is as close to the ocean as youre likely to get, with proximity to the City Centre, Cliftons beaches, Table Mountain, Sea Point and Camps Bay making this area central, yet private.
Camps Bay
Camps Bay is the trendy heart of the Atlantic seaboard, the palm-line, white-sand beach with an abundance of vibey restaurants and classy eateries complete the picture postcard setting. Against the backdrop of the twelve apostles along the length of Table Mountain and its pristine beaches, this gem has been cherished by locals and travellers alike from as far back as 1786, when The Roundhouse was first established as a guard post by the Dutch East India Company.
18 blog posts for this area.
Cape Town CBD
Between the ocean and the majestic Table Mountain (often with its cloudy table cloth) you will find the centre of Cape Town. The Mother City CBD is a vibrant and energetic city centre that has not succumbed to urban decay. There are countless points of interest, such as the South African Museum, Company Gardens, the Castle of Good Hope, Government Avenue and many museums and galleries lining the centre of town.
Enjoy the bohemian and exciting experience of Long Street, with everything from curios to clothing stores to night clubs and bars. Green Market Square is nice and central, and a good point from which to spread out and explore the city on foot, via guided walks such as Cape Spirit City Walk or the Footsteps to Freedom walk. Always a-buzz with international cuisine, all manner of music and clubs, theatre and art, Cape Town has a lot to offer to even the most discerning visitor.
60 blog posts for this area.
Clifton
Clifton is fondly known as Cape Towns St Tropez, and with four stunning beaches ranked within the top ten beaches in the world and awarded with Blue Flag status, it has to be on your bucket list of beaches to visit whilst you stay around Cape Town.
First Beach - popular with the surfers and volley ball players
Second and Third Beaches are very family oriented and popular with those who want to enjoy their holidays on the beach.
Fourth Beach is The Family Beach, it has the necessary showers, public toilets, umbrellas and deck chairs available for rent and the essential places to buy cold drinks and snacks. Fourth Beach proudly has Blue Flag status, so you are assured the beach is environmentally friendly.
Life guards are on duty throughout the peak season, so only the chilly waters are your excuse not to enjoy a quick swim.
3 blog posts for this area.
De Waterkant
At the confluence of Bo Kaap, the CBD and Green Point you will find De Waterkant. A modern bohemian suburb with many wonders to share hidden amongst its tree-lined and cobbled streets. This fashionably trendy area has been the focus of urban gentrification by the city of Cape Town and the results are amazing, blending old and new world feel along with some of the citys best restaurants, wine bars and delis.
The cottages, that are such a signature visual item for these streets, date back to the 18th century and miraculously remained unscathed during the rigorous relocation programmes under the Apartheid Government (unlike District Six). Being so central, most things of interest are a walk, bus or a quick Uber ride away.

Foreshore
Adjacent to the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront, the Foreshore lies on land reclaimed from the sea between 1930 and 1940, extending Cape Town a further 2 kms into the bay. Centrally located, the area has excellent proximity and connectivity to the city centre and various sites of cultural and historical importance.
For the business traveller, the foreshore is particularly well suited due to the fact that its rubbing shoulders with the V&A Waterfront and the Cape Town International Convention Center - The CTICC
2 blog posts for this area.
Fresnaye
Minutes away from the V&A Waterfront, sheltered from the South Easter and with quick access to some of the most prime real estate in the city, Fresnaye commands views of the Atlantic, Table Bay and the historically iconic Robben Island. The highly fashionable area hosts the peninsulas legendary sunsets from the slopes of a mountain over the sea.
2 blog posts for this area.
Gardens is a tranquil quarter, even though its close to the Cape Town CBD, and is known for its authentic colonial mansions (with high ceilings and wooden floors) and its many little galleries, shops and restaurants. It sits at the foot of Table Mountain, and is tucked between Oranjezicht and Tamboerskloof (on the lower slopes of Table Mountain and Lions Head, respectively). Being so centrally located allows you to quickly access the popular Atlantic beaches across Kloof Nek, and also the Table Mountain cableway as well as other highlights like the Castle of Good Hope and the V&A Waterfront.
Gardens is full items of historical significance, such as South African Museum, the oldest in the country, which was established in 1825, or the first statue erected in South Africa, that of Sir George Grey, which can be found in front of the public library. These are the sort of things that give Gardens its feel, steeped in history but vibrant and modern, close to the action yet still remaining calm and quiet.

Hout Bay
Fondly known as The Republic of Hout Bay by its residents on account of the fact that there are only three access roads, is a beautiful coastal town with a long history. Within the Hout Bay valley you will find country living, a fishing village and an informal settlement. All three of these locations within a location add their own measure of local flavour.
For the best fish and chips in the cape, you must pop by Fish on the Rocks, a very casual chip shop thats been around for decades.
Another Hout Bay icon is Dunes restaurant, with its amazing play area for kids, spectacular views and brilliant seafood & cocktail specials. Various markets adorn the wharfs and quays of the working harbour on weekends, with the full bouquet of sea-related activities available to you, from sea-kayaking to shark-cage diving to tours to Seal Island.
Hout Bay has long been seen as a kind of retreat from the hectic nature of city life, and the locals make sure that it stays that way.

Mouille Point
Fronted by a series of tall and well-appointed apartment buildings, the view encompasses Table Bay, Lions Head and Robben Island, the eye-catching candy cane lighthouse is the oldest one in operation in the country. Right beside the Cape Town Stadium and the V&A Waterfront, the area also hosts various sporting and sailing clubs.
5 blog posts for this area.
Oranjezicht
On the steep slopes above the trendy Kloof Street, with its vibey café culture, Oranjezicht contains large homes with gracious views over the city. A short walk down the hills will take you to Long and Loop Street, with its bohemian charm, or up the hill, takes you to the Base Station of the Table Mountain Cable Way.
Sea Point
Cosmopolitan Sea Point lies between Mouille Point, Green Point and Bantry Bay. Its vibrancy is created by the multitude of shops, restaurants, cafes and its splendid beach front promenade (featuring many childrens playgrounds and jogging tracks). The iconic Ritz Hotel with its 360° rotating restaurant is still in operation on the dividing line of the main road, above which are the large private villas on the slopes of Signal Hill, below which are the luxurious beachfront apartments lining the promenade.
17 blog posts for this area.
Tamboerskloof
This is the oldest residential area in Cape Town, and is a beautiful mix of art deco and old Victorian buildings is a great place to set up base centrally and explore the city.
Despite its proximity to the city, the area is quiet and the tree lined streets echo a bygone time.
Due to its situation on the slopes of Lions Head, one enjoys the most spectacular sunrises, with views across the city, the bay, and in the distance, the Hottentots Hollands Mountains.
The Victoria and Albert Waterfront
The V&A Waterfront is one of Cape Towns most well-known tourist attractions, a fully operational harbour set amidst a world class shopping mall. Spectacular apartments line the sailing marina and surround The One and Only Hotel. The Clock Tower, the Time Ball Tower and the various boat tours and activities are all popular year round attractions.

New Model Residence at Apex Park City
Apex Residences Park City Project Update
Exciting news has hit the streets of Park City Utah, especially on High Mountain Road in Canyons Village at Park City Resort. The construction crews have worked diligently all summer long completing various segments of Apex Residences Park City. The fruits of their efforts can be seen throughout the project with the most obvious and exciting being the newly completed residences, which includes the model residence, now available to tour.
The New Model Residence
As you drive through Canyons Village up High Mountain Road, youll round the corner adjacent to Park City Resorts Red Pine Gondola. There youll see upslope to the right the recently planted landscaping and directional signs pointing you to the newly completed model residence. Our new model features the Fresh Powder interior finish package and as well as the stunning furnishings by Andrea Lawrence Wood. Once inside the residence, youll make your way up the stairs past the lower level family room area to the main floor. Here is where the real fun begins! Featuring a sophisticated and modern gourmet kitchen, large dining area plus a comfortable and relaxing living room with two-story high glass windows that frame most incredible views Canyons Village has to offer.
Sales Activity
With the end of summer came a lot of interest in Canyons Village, especially Apex Residences. In the past 90 days, five more residences have gone under contract. That brings the total of residences under contract to 41 with 20 remaining for sale. Also, the first two completed residences have closed which includes the model residence. With the good winter and ski season upon us, we feel confident that many more Apex Residences will go under contract.
In this Apex project update video, Columbus Pacific project manager Tony Tyler shows off the newly completed model residence.
From high above the newly invigorated Canyons Village at Park City, Apex Residences presents a new brand of modern sophistication and a lifestyle to be cherished for generations to come. Your mountain retreat awaits. Check out our various exquisite ski-in, ski-out residences and call 435.429.APEX to schedule a private tour today! Be sure to visit our sister property, Viridian Park City, on the 11th fairway of Canyons Golf Course.

UNBEARABLE: Is This the Next Democrat Running for Governor?	
Posted on June 5, 2017 by ColoradoPeakPolitics
Do we have a new Democratic candidate rehearsing their entrance into the gubernatorial race by following in the footsteps of our banjo-playing governor?
Check out the surveillance camera:
It appears the potential candidate is uncertain about their skills as a musician, although we think the bear plays better than Hickenlooper.
But the bear quickly tired of the whole musical scene, stole some food from the freezer, caused some minor damage, then left.
Yup, its a Democrat.

About Divorce
Obtaining a divorce can be straightforward if both parties agree that the marriage is over. However, difficulties can arise in resolving how and when to separate, where to live, and the arrangements for children and finances.
The only grounds for divorce are that your marriage has irretrievably broken down and one of five 'facts' must be proved:
(1)adultery
(2)unreasonable behaviour
(3)desertion for at least two years
(4)separation for at least two years with consent
(5)separation for over five years (consent not required)
If one of the five facts applies, what happens next?
It is often sensible to try to obtain your partner's consent to the divorce and try to reach agreement over the contents of the petition. Only a brief outline of circumstances needs to be given at this stage.
What about the children?
A form is also sent to the court with the divorce petition which will outline the arrangements for your children. The law encourages couples to try to agree those arrangements. Divorce proceedings still continue if no agreement is reached.
How long does the divorce process take?
The divorce takes approximately four-six months although the Decree Absolute is often not obtained until the finances are resolved. This may be much later.
Click for the procedure to issue divorce proceedings.

Move over Bali and discover Bintan Island
27 December, 2017
5 Min Read
Singapore is a favourite getaway spot for Hong Kong expats  many go there for the citys fabulous shopping and dining. But did you know that a glorious Southeast Asian beach retreat is just a 60-minute catamaran ride away? Bintan Resorts is an integrated tropical resort destination on the northern coast of Indonesias Bintan Island, and home to world-class accommodations, designer golf courses and loads of recreational activities; plus, you can venture beyond the properties to explore the islands natural, cultural and historical attractions. Here are some highlights.
Crystal Lagoon offers many facilities
Discovering Bintan Island
Treasure Bay Bintan
This 338-hectare waterfront resort city is home to the largest manmade salt-water lagoon in Southeast Asia, the 6.3-hectare Crystal Lagoon. Activities on its spectacular crystal-clear waters include bumper boat rides, water tricycles, sea scooters, a Jetovater, and even a floating obstacle course. If you prefer to stay dry, try out the land activities such as electric scooters, two-wheeler transports and ATVs.
The Canopi
Located right beside Crystal Lagoon is The Canopi, providing campers and adventure-seekers a feeling of being one with nature, with modern-day luxuries including air- conditioning, barbecue pits, Wi-Fi and spa facilities. The Canopis safari tents are uniquely designed, inspired by 18th-century colonial explorers; each more than 400 square feet of space and can sleep up to four people.
Lagoi Bay
Lagoi Bay is set to be the Heart of Bintan, a 1,300-hectare beachside development offering accommodations, outdoor activities, shopping, and plenty of dining options.
Grand Lagoi Village
This 196-room property is next to Plaza Lagoi mall and the beach, and is surrounded by Lake Lagoi, a stunning fresh-water fishing lake. Theres a rooftop infinity pool, an entertainment centre with interactive games, a movie room and a kids club.
Holiday Villa Pantai Indah
Set on the eastern quarter of beautiful Lagoi Bay, this tastefully appointed villa-only resort has modern one- and two-bedroom villas with private pools. The resorts beach overlooks a cluster of three small islands well-suited for snorkelling and scuba diving with their rich marine life.
Lagoi Bay Lantern Park
At one of Lagoi Bay Bintans newest attractions youll find lantern displays of all kinds of marine creatures, along with endangered land species such as the Javan rhinoceros, Komodo dragon and Sumatran elephant. On a similar note, the Odong Odong (a mini car with music and lights) is available for families to ride around and have fun together.
Around Bintan Island
Fascinating Berakit
Mangrove Tour
The Sebung River is home to a remarkable mangrove eco-system. On the serene 90-minute journey youll discover unique plants and spot animals such as monkeys, snakes, monitor lizards and kingfishers, and be amazed by the beautiful sights of a star-filled sky and fireflies lighting up the river on the night-tour option.
Panglong Village, Berakit
This is Bintan Islands largest village of sea gypsies  nomads who are born, live and die on the oceans waters. Get a peek into local life  think rural villages, stilt houses on waters and salted fish being dried in the open. As with visiting a friends home, a gift for the children, such as snacks, will be appreciated here.
Penyengat Island
Home to the rulers of the last phase of the Malay Kingdom, Penyengat island has historical sites including the tomb of national hero Raja Ali Fisabililah, a custom hall, an old arsenal building and a palace. The brightly coloured Sultan of Riaus Grand Mosque has a hand-written Quran on display thats over 150 years old. Reach the island by water taxi from the jetty at Tanjung Pinang.
The amazing Lohan statues of Vihara
Senggarang Village
This Chinese village houses Bintans oldest temples, including the Banyan Tree Temple, now entwined by the twisting roots of banyan trees. Vihara Sengarang is a complex of four temples paying homage to different deities, including the Supreme Lord of the Dark Heaven; its said to be over 300 years of age. Visitors can join a South Bintan tour to visit both Penyengat Island and Senggarang.
Vihara Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva
Opened in 2017, this Bintan Island temple is home to 500 life-sized Lohan (or arhat) statues  each one human-like and different from the next. Try finding Journey to the Wests Tripitaka or Romance of the Three Kingdoms Guan Gong amongst the faces.
Vihara Avalokitesvara Graha
Also known as Kwan Yin Temple, this building houses one of the tallest Goddess of Mercy statues in Southeast Asia, made of brass and coated in 22 carat gold. An impressive dragon-fruit plantation sits at the front of the temple.
Grotto Santa Maria
Located near Trikora beach on Bintan Islands east coast, the Grotto Santa Maria can be seen on a day-trip itinerary to Berakit, the sea gypsy village. Follow the trail up to the little chapel and look out for the statue of Santa Maria well preserved in a cave.

The Huntsville Hospital Auxiliary presents Adventures in Fashion at the Algonquin Theatre on Friday April 26th at 7pm!
All monies realized will be used towards the purchase of two defibrillators at a cost of $28,000. Defibrillation is a procedure used to treat life threatening conditions that affect the rhythm of the heart such as cardiac arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. This procedure involves the delivery of an electric shock to the heart which causes depolarization of the heart muscles and re-establishes normal conduction of the hearts electrical impulse.

Todays theatre operators understand that people go to the movies for more than just the content of a film. Going to the movies has become an experience, and that experience has come to include an ever-growing variety of food and beverage options. Its therefore surprising that concessions, while now an established and vital component of the health of the industry and the guest experience, were once an afterthought at best.
In this timeline, we take a look at the evolution of concessions at the movies, from the industrys initial rejection of concessions altogether to todays revenue-generating mainstay of the moviegoing experience.
Moving pictures grew in popularity and availability in the early 1900s and theatres began to pop up around the country to capitalize on this growing industry. Nickelodeons were the first generation of theatrea small auditorium used to host both films and live vaudeville shows. The nickelodeon moniker comes from a combination of the nickel attendance cost and the Odeon, a smaller, acoustically-designed theatre for musical and literary performances in ancient Greece.
Studios developed and the short films became feature films. This fueled a shift from small nickelodeons into movie palaces during the 1910s. Management at both nickelodeons and movie palaces avoided food and drink because of the mess created. Vendors would attempt to sell popcorn and peanuts in the aisles, similar to what we experience at sporting events today. There were also many candy shops located in close proximity to the theatres so the food and drink still easily found its way into the theaters.
Theatre operators eventually realized the demand for food and drink as part of the customer experience. As a way to monetize this demand during the Great Depression, many theatres would lease space in their lobby to vendors. Eventually, the concession stand became integrated into the design of newly built theatres in the 1930s.
The growth in popularity of candy stalled a bit during the sugar rationing of World War II, but this opened the door for a growth in the popularity of popcorn, now considered a staple of the movie industry. Today, popcorn is such an essential part of the moviegoing experience that it has come to symbolize the movie industry itself.
When concessions were recognized as not only integral to the customer experience but also the most profitable area of operations, theatre operators focused on promoting concession sales. From 1948 to 1956, concession sales were forty times higher, even with theatre attendance declining during this period.
The intermission was created in part to provide the audience a chance to go to the concession stand to refill popcorn and drinks. In addition, ads during intermissions were geared at reminding viewers of the snacks available.
Today, we see a wide variety of ways in which food and drink are offered at the movie theatre. Some operators have implemented self-serve environments similar to browsing the aisles of a convenience store, while others offer in-theatre dining service in which your food is brought to your seat, ensuring you dont miss any of your movie.
In perhaps one of the most significant shifts in theatre food and beverage is the introduction of alcoholic beverages, with many theatres now serving alcohol both at traditional concession stands and at bar lounges in their lobbies. Considering that many theatre patrons dine out immediately before or after attending a film, theatre operators are giving guests an incentive to choose their theatre as a one-stop location for these social activities.
The results have been impressive, with leading operators reporting record-setting revenue growth in concessions. AMC reported a record $4.62 in concessions revenue per patron for 2015, and Regal reported record concession per cap in each of 2015s quarters, with the highest quarterly concession growth rate in their history from Q3 to Q4 2015.
The shift toward enhancing the customer experience through food and beverage options has been established, and will continue to evolve as more theatres interpret the lucrative progression in distinctive ways that suit the demands of the modern audience.
In our next Insight Center article on this topic, well take a look at the variety of concession designs and expanded food and beverage offerings that are driving this industry transformation, including inspired menus, craft cocktails, and streamlined wait service.

Courtney Love to Pen Her Memoirs in Tell-All Autobiography
Shauna Wright
Share on Twitter
Share on Facebook
In whats sure to be one of the dishiest celebrity memoirs to date, former Hole frontwoman and Kurt Cobains widow, Courtney Love, has inked a deal to write her autobiography.
The still-untitled book, which will be published by HarperCollins imprint William Morrow, will reportedly set the record straight about her well-known spats with other celebrities, her acting and singing career, her substance abuse problems, her marriage to Cobain, and her contentious relationship with their daughter, Frances Bean.
Love joins the ranks of other recently-signed celebrity memoirists such as Neil Young, Pete Townshend, Carole King and Gregg Allman. Her book will be out sometime next fall.

Water, weather combine to cause baitfish die off	
Fish washed ashore around the Gulf State Park pier earlier this week.
By John Mullen
July 13, 2018  Orange Beach, AL (OBA®)  A placid Gulf and hot conditions have combined to create a fish die-off of a species of baitfish that gathers around the Gulf State Park Pier.
Its just your typical dog days of summer, Orange Beach Director of Coastal Resources Phillip West said. Species like LYs or some call them pogies like to congregate around structures and suck up all the oxygen and perish. Its typical of the conditions and the species. Some years we dont have the heat or the stable conditions that create this lack of oxygen in the water because of the seas. Right now we are in that phase again.
These LYs are dying under the pier.
Longtime pier fisherman and semi-retired fishing guide David Thornton said the right combination of environmental factors caused the recent die off.
The meteorological condition of calm wind, calm water and clear skies can cause the water around the pier to heat up even more, Thornton said. The other day it was like a perfect storm of a situation. We had this huge die off overnight and all these fish started floating up to the surface. Just about daylight, a light breeze picked up out of the south onshore. It pushed all these bloated fish up on the shoreline. It was like a ring around the tub on the beach on either side of the pier where all these dead fish floated up.
Phillip West
So far, the dead baitfish only showed up at the state pier but West said he wouldnt be surprised to see them at the Four Seasons pier on the east side of the Cotton Bayou Beach Access.
I would expect that to happen, West said. But thats not been reported to me from our folks. We have shoreline crews on the cleanup daily and we also have crews on the beach, beach ambassadors and clean-sweep crews.
Those same conditions, Thornton said, help lead to the famous jubilees experienced on the Eastern Shore. One occurred on the morning of July 12. Many times, shrimp, crab, flounder and a variety of deeper water fish head for the shallows along the Eastern Shore bringing crowds of people to reap the seafood bounty.
A jubilee takes place when a wedge of hypoxic water presses all the way up the shoreline, moved along by an incoming tide, Thornton said. The offshore breeze accentuates the phenomenon by pushing the lighter, fresher, more oxygenated water away from the shore. So that is a totally different mechanism in play, and rarely do the fish actually die unless they get gigged.
On the current fish die-off happening at the pier, West says he doesnt expect it to involve other species of fish or marine life.
Most other schooling species are a little tougher and move more, West said. The LYs might get in there and stay in a tight school around the structure for days but your other schooling fish like Spanish, bonito and even ladyfish theyre going to move about so much more. Theyre not going to confine themselves and theyre not going to create their own problem.
If other species start dying off and washing ashore it could mean a bigger problem, West said.
I wouldnt expect to see other species from this, West said. If we started seeing catfish and skates and rays and other things then I would suspect we may have almost a jubilee phenomenon at the bottom where the bottom strata of water is depleted of oxygen. Its another seasonal occurrence.
Its to a pretty limited species. If we started seeing other species showing up in a die off then were talking brown tide, red tide type stuff. These LYs, theyre pretty fragile anyway. Theyre a forage fish and thats why they are around the structure. They forage around it but they also have cover from their predators.
Thornton said this was not a fish kill or manmade cause for the fish to be dying but part of life for Gulf animals.
Some folks were getting upset like it was unnatural and like it was a fish kill but its nothing that we havent seen practically every summer since I been fishing down there since the early 1970s, Thornton said. Theres billions of them out there and thousands are dying off.

Picture of the lovely light in a church by Rick McEvoy interior photographer
A study of the light in a scene  how candles and a window light this serene interior picture taken in a church
November 08, 2016
This is an HDR Merge image created using the correctly exposed image (1/30th second) and the two stops underexposed image (1/125th second).
I couldn't merge the two stop under and two stop over exposed images, as Lightroom could not match them. I have not come across this before, so tried the correct and two stop under exposed images.
And it worked absolutely fine.
Both images were taken using an aperture of F8 with an ISO of 1600. Images captured on my Canon 6D with Canon 24-105mm lens, hand held using the AV Mode.
This images were taken in a church in Corfu this summer. I was drawn to the light streaming in through the window, and the warm glow of the candles. Which is good as I am consciously looking for interesting light now.
This picture was taken at a focal length of 47mm, as I wanted to isolate just this small part of this stunning, atmospheric church. I have excluded a lot of things from this image, getting down to these two elements.
The candles and the window. This is the story.
The HDR Merged image was too bright. I checked this by adding the image to my target collection in Lightroom after creating it, then checking it on the screen of my IPad, after Lightroom Mobile had done its stuff.
To do this I right click on the image, choose Add to target collection, and before you know it, there is is. Well I had time to put the kettle on and make a cuppa, but that is the fault of my wi-if and not Adobe.
Adobe get blamed for a lot of speed problems with Lightroom, but not my office wi-if!
White balance
Tricky one. The light sources are the sun streaming in through the window, and the glow (I typed in golf not glow which the spell checker could not handle) of the candles. I always shoot in RAW, so I can sort this after the event.
This is how my correction of the white balance went.
As Shot - the light was too yellow
Auto - this cooled the image down
Daylight - orange
Cloudy - more orange
Shade - even more orange
Tungsten  not that bad to be honest
Fluorescent  erm no
Flash  even more no.
I ended up doing a custom white balance, as there was no neutral grey part of the image I could select. I just moved the temperature slider until I got what looked the best for me. Which turned out to be virtually the same as the Auto setting.
Quick Lightroom Tip  it is always worth trying Auto White Balance, and the other presets, even if the the names do not feel like they might make sense to you. You never know - one of these settings might just work fine.
There was one thing that I had to sort  there was a band of blue light at the top of the window, where daylight was coming in above the curtains. Now I know that this was actually there, but the processing exaggerated it, and as it is distracting it needs to be removed. I got rid of the worst of the blue by painting over the band of colour and increasing the temperature all the way to 100. There was still more to do in Photoshop but this was a good start to fixing this problem.
On with the processing. I always start with White Balance.
Contrast
I pushed this a lot, to +76. Sometimes HDR images can lose the contrast in the processing.
Then the rest of the work was done in the basic panel.
I just moved the sliders to get the best look and feel. I wont bore you with the detail of this, but am happy to tell anyone who wants to know what the slider numbers were.
I darkened the overall image, and added a vignette to draw you into the light.
A couple of other little things I did to this image.
I increased the highlights in the candles by painting with the brush to make the candles even brighter using the highlights slider in the adjustment brush. I also painted clarity onto the window to bring out the patterns in the glass. These little details can make an image.
Noise
A quick word about noise. I don't do anything with it. There is lots of noise in this image. But does anyone care apart from other photographers?
Of course not. So I just accept it is part of the picture. I really do not worry about it.
Quick trip to Photoshop to fix that window, and we are nearly done here. When I say quick trip I mean I have asked Lightroom to edit the image in Photoshop, then gone to finish off my cuppa, to find it waiting for me!
I cloned out the remaining blue in the window, which went fine. I also cloned out the blue in the wall. And that took a long old time to get absolutely right. I know when an edit has worked when I cant see what I have done.
Oh yes  I clicked on the black and white option in Lightroom for a quick sneak preview of the inevitable black and white image, which you just know is to follow. Tomorrow I will produce, write about and post the black and white version of this picture.

Roger Allen, RLA Group CEO contributed to the brand new book titled Hotels and Resorts  An Investors Guide. The book presents a comprehensive analysis of how hotels, resorts, serviced apartments, golf courses, spas, gyms and health clubs are developed, operate and are valued, providing an invaluable guidance to international investors, developers, asset managers and students in related subject areas..
Drawing on 40 years experience of leisure property, hospitality and wellbeing industries the authors provide invaluable guidelines for valuation of a spa and wellness facility as an integral part of a hotel or resort development and as a stand-alone entity. Value determination of a spa can be a complex process given the disparity in different types of spa facilities, categories, terminologies, business models, organizational design and management performance. The authors aim to simplify this complexity and provide clarity on how to determine the financial performance of the spa facility and its correlation to the property value.

Grassroots 2019: A Day at Capitol Hill
By John Campbell, AIA, RIBA, LEED AP
As Part of the AIA 2019 Grassroots conference in Washington DC, Paul Avazier (AIA PHL President-Elect), Michael Skolnick (AIA PA & AIA National Strategic Council Rep), Beth Maier (AIA Bucks County Rep) and myself (AIA PHL President), participated with over 450 fellow AIA members from across the country in the AIA national board government advocacy day on Capitol Hill lobbying our senators and house representatives.
The day was extremely well organized by the AIA and their consultant Soapbox. This included a full briefing on the 2 issues being advanced and how to use the limited time with the Congressional delegates in the most effective manner to deliver the message and make the ask.
The two AIA federal agenda issues; Energy Efficiency and School Safety.
Energy Efficiency: The issue is that the main federal policy that is meant to increase the energy efficiency of buildings is only positively impacting a small percentage of them. The solution being asked is for Congress to support updating the federal tax code to increase energy efficiency in commercial and multi-family buildings by expanding the current definition of what is considered qualified improvement property or QIP, to include energy efficient technologies. This change would allow building owners and developers to write off a certain percentage of depreciation costs if they install energy efficient technologies such as HVAC, mechanical insulation, lighting, windows, roofs, submeters and other building management systems
School Safety: While all sides of the political spectrum agree we need to design our schools to be safe learning environments, most of the nations 122,000 school buildings are not designed to deter school violence. Education officials lack funding and credible information about how school violence can be mitigated through architecture and design. Currently local and state officials lack a central repository of credible best practices, resources and overall safe school design information. The AIA is urging Congress to create this clearinghouse to provide all school officials with a one-stop shop repository of credible best practices to make schools more secure by design and also make design services eligible for existing federal grant funding.
It was a very interesting experience walking the halls of Congress with a lot of waiting between meetings watching the constant flow of groups visiting and lobbying their Congressional delegates. While in most instances we met with staff members, we did meet with Rep Dwight Evans (PA District 03). Overall the meetings were very engaging and the two issues were very well received by both sides of the aisle. With around 15 minutes to make the case, it required being concise and focused on the message, making the ask and building a rapport. It was a thoroughly enjoyable day and a great learning experience. To round the day off, there was a Congressional Reception at the Library of Congress, which is a stunning piece of architecture.
The key lesson from the day was how important it is for the profession to articulate key positions that are meaningful to the profession and society at large and then to advocate for them at all levels of government; Federal, State, Local and Community. We certainly encourage everyone to become engaged in this process.

Norah Head Beach
Norah Head Beach, Norah Head NSW 2263
view listing
Soldiers Beach, on the south side of the head, faces southeast and, with a well protected north end, is a favourite with board-riders when the summer northeaster is up. Sweetly-curved one kilometre in length, the beach features clusters of rocks that build nice sand-covered reefs but demand due care when falling off your board. There are reliable waves year-round, best when the swell comes in from the south or east. The left-hand point-break is beloved of long-boarders, although as soon as it gets over two metres the short-boarders take an interest in it too. The beach break can be world-class on its day, notably a spot down the south end called Sunset which can generate big rights and lefts with a heavy hold-down section.

Norah Head Lighthouse
Bush Street, Norah Head NSW 2263
0452 564102
view listing
Norah Head Lighthouse was built from 1901 to 1903. Perched on a headland, the lighthouse takes in magnificent ocean vistas and is the Central Coast's most spectacular icon. A walking track skirts around the side of the lighthouse and leads to stairs which climb down to the rock platform below and to Lighthouse Beach. Norah Head Lighthouse celebrated its Centenary on 15 November 2003. Apart from the electrification of the light, few changes have been made to the lighthouse since it was established. Buildings on the headland comprise the Lighthouse, Flag Locker, Head Keepers Quarters and the first and second assistant lightkeeper's quarters as well as stables. Two of the cottages are available to rent for tourist accommodation. Tours of the lighthouse are available from 10am to 1pm seven days per week. There is a fee for the tours. The views from the top of the lighthouse are magnificent.

The best part about my dealership was the my salesman. I sat down, gave him the specifications of what I was looking for, and he said to me, "Come back on Thursday, your car will be here. " I went home, and came back on Thursday, and BOOM. There was my car. The color, the options, and manual transmission. We even negotiated the price a bit, and brought it down about $1000.

Even if you choose a quality beer and pour the perfect foam head, if you dont consider your glassware, youre limiting the beer-drinking experience. Many beer experts believe that unique glassware can have a variety of effects on the the beer drinking experience.
According to the popular website, Beeradvocate:
As soon as the beer hits the glass, its color, aroma and taste is altered, your eye candy receptors tune in, and your anticipation is tweaked. Hidden nuances become more pronounced, colors shimmer, and the enjoyment of the beer simply becomes a better, more complete experience.
Experts like Ray Daniels, the creator and director of the Cicerone Certification Program and president of the Craft Beer Institute, agree that glass- ware is essential for an elevated beer-drinking experience.
If a customer asks for an imperial stout, do you know what glass to pour it in? What if he orders a saison or a hop-forward beer?
The Beer Glass
Wondering what terms to use to describe the different parts of a basic beer glass how these parts relate to the beer it contains?
When you serve a beer, the head sits at the top near the lip or mouth of the glass and the body of the beer takes up the body or bowl of the glass. The base of the glass keeps the beer steady and upright when its placed down on the bar or table. Although the shape and size of beer glassware can widely vary, every beer glass can be identified by these three basic parts.

Are you ready to dive into the specifics of beer glassware? Dont worry, your bar doesnt necessarily need to be stocked with every single one of these. However, if you identify as a craft beer bar, you might want to consider it. This is a great way to start thinking about how you can create an elevated drinking experience that customers will want to come back for.
Stop serving every beer in the same glass! Take a look at the list below to diversify your beer glass collection.
Shaker Pint
The pint glass, or the standard pub shaker, gets a bad rap among most beer enthusiasts. These glasses werent intend- ed for beer. They were originally used behind the bar to shake cocktails. In the post-prohibition era when American beers were less alcoholic and bland, people started using the pint glass for beer. This practice stuck.
If youre serving a finely crafted beer in a pint glass, your cus- tomers grip will warm the beer very quickly and he wont fully experience the full aroma or the proper head. With many craft beers these days coming in around 8% ABV, filling up a stan- dard pint glass would be a bit over the top.
Although the pint glass is often criticized, it remains a staple of the American bar scene because it is durable, stackable, easy to clean, and beer companies often provide them free of charge. If youre trying to use these bad boys, grab one when a patron orders an easy going beer like an Amber Ale, Pale Ale, American Lager or Bocks.
ENJOY WITH
Amber Ales
Pale Ales
American Lagers
Bocks
Nonik Pint
This glass is similar to the shaker pint glass but its slightly more fancy. It has a protruding ring near the top to help with handing and to develop a more substantial head than a shak- er pint. By concentrating the aromas of the beer in the head, the first sip is more fragrant. This glass is best used for most American and English styles like Stouts, Pilsners, Brown Ales, and Porters.
ENJOY WITH
Stouts
Pilsners
Brown Ales
Porters
Sam Adams Perfect Pint
Specifically designed to hold Sam Adams Boston Lager, this glass offers beer lovers a full sensory drinking experience. The outward turn of the lip places the beer at the very front of a drinkers palate to maximize the malts sweetness. The narrow top helps to retain the hop aroma and sustain the head. With thinner walls and a rounder shape, the right beer temperature is maintained and the aromas are gathered in a single place. Finally, the bottom of the glass features a nucleation site (laser etchings) that creates bubbles for a consistent aroma release.
ENJOY WITH
Sam Adams
Boston Lager
Snifter
Also used for brandy and cognac, this glass has a wide bowl, a tapered mouth, and a stem to help capture the aromas and volatiles of stronger beers. Their shape helps to keep all the aroma in and enhances the nose of malty, complex brews that are usually strong and high in alcohol (ex. anything that starts with Imperial or Double).
ENJOY WITH
Imperial IPAs
Imperial Stouts
Barleywines
Strong Ales
Stange
This glass originated in Cologne, Germany. It is most often used for Kolsch beer, a style native to Cologne, and it is designed to fit into a tray used by waiters at Cologne beer halls and pubs. The German word, stange, means stick. This glass is similar to a pint glass because it is narrow and cylindrical. However, its more slim than an average pint glass, helping to preserve the beers aroma and to amplify hop and malt nuances. In addition to traditional Cologne beers, the Stange is also used for Altbiers, Bocks, and more delicate beers.
ENJOY WITH
Altbiers
Bocks
Czech Pilseners
Lambics
Rye Beers
Tulip
A tulip glass is tulip-shaped (obviously). The glass is stemmed and the top pushes outwards to form a lip, which helps to capture the fluffy head, make the body bulbous, and deliver the beer to the center of the tounge. Ideal for beers that have a complex aroma from the head of the beer, this glass should be used for Belgian styles, Fruit Beers, Red Ales, Lambics, and beers with a strong flavor and nose.
ENJOY WITH
Belgian Beers
Fruit Beers
Red Ales
Lambics
Thistle
Similar to the Tulip glass, the thistle glass has a stem and a bulb-like bowl. However, this glass is a bit taller and is less curvy around the lip. It was specifically designed for Scottish Ales because Scotlands official flower is a thistle. Its also used for strong brews like Belgian ales, and Double IPAs. The bulb-like bowl lets drinkers swirl around the beer so they can help release the full aromas.
ENJOY WITH
Scottish Ales
Belgian Ales
Double IPAs
Pilsner
The Pilsner glass holds 12 ounces of beer, making it smaller than some of the other glasses on the list. It has triangular dimensions (almost like a trumpet) to help capture the sparkling colors of Pilsners and other wheat beers while still retaining their head.
ENJOY WITH
Imperial Pilsners
Red Lagers
Malt Liquors
Bocks
Oversized Wine
This glass is best used for strong, high gravity beers and Belgian Ales. The size of this glass allows for headspace and the bowl helps to create an awesome nose. This glass works much like a Tulip or Goblet.
ENJOY WITH
Double IPAs
Imperial IPAs
Dark Ales
Belgian Ales
Weizen
The Wheat Beer glass is much taller than a standard pint glass. It starts out skinny and widens slightly at the top and it has thin, lengthy walls to help showcase the beers color. This glass is designed to leave room for headspace, which is necessary for the fluffy head of wheat beers. The design also helps to lock in the banana aromas.
ENJOY WITH
Wheat Ales
Hefeweizens
Dunkelweizens
Mug
Usually the glass of choice at beer halls, this mug is large, durable, and meant to hold a ton of beer. Since the main purpose of this glass is usually drinking large quantities with a group of friends, this glass doesnt focus on bringing out the clarity, carbonation, or aroma of specific beers. It has a large handle for easy-gripping and its tough enough to take a good clink.
ENJOY WITH
Amber/Red Ales
Amber/Red Lagers
Dark Wheat Ales
IPAs
Stouts/Porters
Seidel Mug
Once popular for its grenade-like appearance, this old-style glass nearly disappeared in the early 2000s. However, it is back in use. An old British tradition, this jug has dimpled sides, a wide mouth, thick glass, and a sturdy handle. It is believed the dimple pattern was introduced merely to use less glass in production. The mugs thick walls help to keep it cool and the handle is great for easy gripping. Many like to drink from them because of their heritage and old-school coolness. Although they are back for now, not everyone is a fan. Some drinkers think the mug is too clunky and has poor head retention and bartenders have trouble storing them because they cant be stacked.
ENJOY WITH
Amber/Red Ales
Amber/Red Lagers
Dark Wheat Ales
IPAs
Stouts/Porters
Stein
Often confused with a mug, the beer stein is the same shape but it has a hinged lid. Traditionally, steins were made with a variety of materials like stoneware, silver, wood, and porcelain. This glass originated because it was believed that a lid would make more drinking more sanitary and prevent the bubonic plague. Today, people still use these glasses but they are more like an ornamental or souvenir glass.
ENJOY WITH
Brown Ales
Red Ales/Lagers
Stouts/Porters
Malt Liquors
Goblet/Chalice
A goblet is delicate and long stemmed and a chalice is heavy and thick walled. Other than looking super majestic, this type of glass is great for head retention, deep sips, and analyzing aromas. Unlike other glassware, these glasses are found in a variety of sizes. Theyre best suited for heavy, malty beers like German Bocks and Belgian Ales.
ENJOY WITH
Belgian IPAs
Belgian Strong
Dark Ales
German Bocks
TeKu
Designed by an Italian top craft beer brewer and a sensory analyst, the TeKu glass is supposed to improve the craft beer drinking experience. Although it was originally created and branded for the Baladin brewery, it quickly grew in popularity and is now widely recognized as one of the top beer glasses today.
The glass has a unique shape. Its almost a hybrid of a long-stemmed wine glass but its designed to capture and release a beers aromas in its outward curve and thin glass. Its been called the true glass for beer geeks.
ENJOY WITH
Ales
Lagers
Porters
Stouts
IPAs
Flute
In addition to holding champagne, this glasss long and narrow body ensures that beers carbonation doesnt dissipate too quickly. It also showcases the carbonation and color and helps to quickly release volatiles to provide a more intense upfront aroma. Sometimes the stem is a bit shorter than a regular champagne flute, but not always. Use this glass when pouring a Pilsner or a beer that emulates wine.
ENJOY WITH
Wild Ales
Bocks
German Lagers/Pilseners
Lambics
Sampler/Tasting
These types of glasses are used for, you guessed it, sampling and tasting. These glasses come in different sizes and shapes and they hold only a small amount of beer so you can sample multiple beers without getting intoxicated. Youll often see breweries using these types of glasses as well as your local pub.
ENJOY WITH
Ales
Lagers
Porters
Stouts
IPAs
+ Hard Cider
After more than 100 years in decline, hard cider is now the worlds fastest-growing adult beverage. Making a massive comeback, cider production more than tripled from 2011 to 2013. A lot of this growth is due to cider rising in popularity outside the U.K. in countries like the U.S., where people are looking for gluten-free options and a taste of something different.
With this huge increase in hard cider production, theres a growing need for specialized glassware. Be a frontrunner. Highlight the cider trend and stock your bar with cider-specific glasses. Your customers will be impressed with your expertise and dedication to the drinking experience.
*Keep in mind, cider glassware is still in its early stages. As the space develops, glassware will likely become more specific to cider types.
Libbey
Utilizing Fizzazz nucleation technology, this glass increases the rich flavors and natural effervescence of hard cider giving the drinker a more beer-like experience. The flared top helps release ciders full aroma palate and its ridges provide a sturdy grip.
Enjoy With
Hard Ciders
Orchard
Specifically designed to showcase cider, this glass helps to deliver crisp, fruit-forward, and fresh apple tastes and aromas. The straight lip of the glass places the cider at the right spot on the palate to showcase the balance between dry and sweet. The wide rounded bowl collects the bright apple aroma and narrows to concentrate the opening to intensify the aroma. The easy-to-hold grip has a smaller surface area so the cider stays cooler for longer. Lastly, the nucleation seed etched in the bottom of the glass slightly enhances the ciders carbonation and it improves aroma and flavor intensity.
Enjoy With
Angry Orchard Hard Cider Varieties
Mikasa Brewmasters
This glass shape is designed to enhance the fruity flavors of hard ciders. The shape features a tapered base that easily fits into a drinkers hand. This both helps the drinker from over-warming the glass and holds the ciders carbonation.

It's tough, but it's not THAT tough. Keep a disc in the fairway and you're fine. I finished my round in 90 minutes. The bigger reason to push for a slower round is to fully appreciate the layout and spend more time throwing multiple discs on some of the more epic holes. Honestly, you could justify throwing a half dozen discs just off the tee on #1.

Harmony Bends is the best course I've ever played... easily.
The next several courses to round out my personal Top 5 or Top 10 could very well change, and jostle around amongst each other for positions 2 thru whatever.
But my list begins with Harmony Bends, every single time. I've pretty much played it at it's worst... never been so glad to own a pair of galoshes.
Really glad I had a chance to play it a 2nd time last Sep... and the weather was great this time.
I've played harder courses.
I've played prettier courses.
I've played more spectacular courses.
I've played more exclusive courses.
I've played more extreme courses.
But I haven't played a better course.

When I think of Shellie Chapman, I see a person who can achieve anything.
When I told her this, she made that disbelieving-sound-slash-modest-laugh, "yeah, right." But I've seen it time and time again during our 20-plus-years friendship.
Especially now, as she battles stage 3 colon cancer.
"I've learned that chemo is like the worst thing ever, and that makes me sad," she tells me. I blink rapidly after hearing her voice break as she explains the effects of chemotherapy. "I feel like I've been pretty strong, but chemo has really broken me down."
My heart aches as she tells me how the building where she gets chemo makes her nauseous, the same thing happens when she "opens my chemo bag."
Then in true Shellie fashion, she sees the silver lining, though her voice is still quiet: "I'm so lucky that I only have to do four treatments. I don't know how people do more than that. I hope I never have to do it again."
One couple's story: A rare win against pancreatic cancer
Did you know: Colon cancer is common but preventable
More: There's a less invasive way to test for colon cancer
Chapman was diagnosed in August, a month before her 41st birthday. The disease has spread to her lymph nodes. She had one surgery already, chemo, and two more surgical procedures are coming up in 2019.
She and her husband, Heath Chapman, make up FLORIDA TODAY's Zap Squad, which covers entertainment and nightlife in Brevard. Both previously worked at FLORIDA TODAY, and both  OK, mainly Heath  get recognized within the community for hosting entertainment videos or taking party pictures.
During the past 10 years, I've watched them grow professionally, each working a day job and then Zapping on the weekends  and balancing family life and extracurricular activities.

There have been panic calls: "We took pictures of these ladies at this club, and they were wearing painted swimsuits. Are these OK to run?" (The answer was no.) "The bar manager is mad about pictures from 'nickel beer night.' He wants the pictures removed from online because he says the patrons are ugly." (The answer was no.)
There have been excited calls, too: "I interviewed KISS!" "We met Brett Michaels!" "We met Screech/Dustin Diamond from 'Saved By the Bell.'"
Celebrity interview: That time 'Screech' brought raunchy standup to Satellite Beach
More: Jason Domulot does a lot for Brevard music scene
More: Zap Squad meets Vanilla Ice at house party in Melbourne Beach
Covering music festivals, taking pictures of people hanging out at Cocoa Beach or happy hour in downtown Melbourne, every Zap Squad had its challenges and its perks.
After the cancer diagnosis, family, friends and the community stepped in to help.
Sonny's BBQ in Melbourne, where Shellie is a server, hosted a "smokin' out cancer" fundraiser. A friend created a Go Fund Me. Their gym hosted a fundraising workout. Ashley's Sports Page on beachside, a frequent Zap Squad hotspot, will host the Shellie Chapman benefit concert on Dec. 15 with some of Brevard's most popular bands.
Funds go toward hospital bills and living expenses.
The Chapmans are touched by the outpouring of support, which helps motivate them to "keep going."

Shellie and Heath Chapman of Melbourne make up FLORIDA TODAY's Zap Squad, and both previously worked at FLORIDA TODAY. Shellie Chapman was diagnosed with colon cancer in August 2018. (Photo: 2012 FLORIDA TODAY FILE)
Some days, however, are especially challenging.
Says Heath, "(Chemo) is like a mental thing as well. She feels great today but she knows she has to go tomorrow and put in something that will make her feel horrible for two weeks. I have to sit there and endure it for her and show that it doesn't affect me, you know? It's torture."
When Shellie was in the hospital recently, Heath reached out to his followers on social media and asked people to send happy pictures with their thoughts for Shellie. In minutes, he had more than 200 photos on that thread.
"I'm really just overwhelmed with the support through the community," she said. "Within days after my diagnosis, everyone chipped in to make sure I'm OK. I'm very blessed."
For more information on the Shellie Chapman benefit concert at Ashley's Sports Page, call 321-693-2915.

Austria Holidays
Introduction
Austria is a fantastic mix of stunning natural scenery and fascinating history and culture. This is the home some of Europes best ski resorts, as well as ancient castles, historic churches, and baroque architecture. A flight from London to Vienna is only about 1.5 hours, and the time difference is one hour ahead of GMT. The currency used in Austria is the Euro.
Regions
Vienna is the capital of Austria, and an excellent place for holiday makers looking for a mix of both old and new. The city has a youthful vibe to it despite the historic palaces and churches scattered throughout the wide streets and open squares. This is a great place to catch up with friends at one of the citys many cafes, take in some live jazz, classical music, or electronic beats, or dress to the nines and attend an elegant ball at a centuries old palace.
Many people take Austria holidays in the winter time to enjoy the fresh air, views, and winter sports opportunities in the mountains. The ski resorts of St. Anton, Zell am See, and Innsbruck are renowned around the world for their vast expanses of ski trails that range from gentle beginner slopes to challenging trails and terrain parks for more advanced skiers and snowboarders. Hiking is also popular in these areas in both the winter and the summer.
Weather
The weather in Austria is changeable depending on the season. Summers run from June to September, and are very warm and sunny. The average temperature in the summer is 25 degrees Celsius. Winters are cold and snowy in Austria, especially in the high Alps. Temperatures can drop as low as -10 degrees in the colder months.
Cost
People who take Austria holidays will find that prices are comparable to other European countries. The following are some basic costs in Austria:
Item Price
Loaf of Bread £1.43
Bottle of Water £1.41
Pint of Beer £2.64
Bottle of Wine £4.71

Stella® Engineering setzt auf Expansion.
Der moderne Zweckbau wurde am 1. Mai 2005 in einer kleinen, feierlichen Eröffnung offiziell seinem Zweck übergeben. Bereits im April war das Unternehmen in das Industriegebiet Klause/Stadt Lindlar umgezogen.
Mit dem Umzug in dem neuen, modernen Produktions- und Bürogebäude, schafft Stella Engineering die Voraussetzungen für weitere Expansion. 10 Jahre nach der Gründung des Unternehmens haben wir jetzt die Möglichkeit geschaffen, die Entwicklung und Produktion näher aneinander zu bringen. So der Geschäftsführende Gesellschafter Dipl. Ing. A. Stella.
Moderne 3D Arbeitsplätze die nahtlos mit dem hauseigenen Prototypenbau und der Fertigung integriert sind, ermöglichen dem Unternehmen auch weiterhin verstärkt auf innovative Produkte, wie der für Europa entwickelte Nullwende Kreis Mäher Diesel Z, zu setzen.
Der Spezialist für Profigeräte hat schon frühzeitig auf europäische Expansion gesetzt und die Zusammenarbeit mit dem agria Werke GmbH intensiviert.
Unser starkes europäisches Vertriebsnetz in Verbindung mit den neuem effizienten Zweckbau ermutigen uns den erfolgreichen Weg der letzten Jahre von innovativen Produkten für die professionelle Rasenpflege noch konsequenter zu gehen so A. Stella.

Rated 4 out of 5 by Lovetogolf from It's a great golf top. Fits well and is light weight but still keeps you warm. I liked this top so much that I ordered another one in White. (I originally got it in Aqua) It took 2 weeks to arrive, but I was very disappointed and had to return it. It's a beautiful white, but there was a grey stain on the front, right about heart level. It was VERY frustrating that they would send me one with such an obvious stain!!! I returned it, but won't order another for fear they'll do the same thing.

Rated 5 out of 5 by vince from excellent quality My wife loved the pullover and received it as a gift,,, we had to exchange it for a different size and the Dicks sporting Good's employees helped tremendously in ordering a different size and having the package delivered to our house,,, They were extremely helpful,... thank you again

Rated 5 out of 5 by martita from It feels like a second skin I like this pullover because it's not bulky. It fits like a second skin and doesn't interfere with my golf swing. It's made well, and it's attractive. I especially like the color.

Our Practice Areas
Assault And Violent Crimes
Are you facing assault or battery charges, or fear that you will be facing these charges?
South Carolina law recognizes that there are two sides to every story. Perhaps you injured someone because you were in immediate danger of being injured yourself. Perhaps you mistakenly injured the wrong person in a drug-altered state that resulted from another person drugging you. Perhaps you injured someone because another threatened your life. Perhaps you were acting in self-defense when you injured another. As you can see, there are many reasons why your behavior might be excused or justified. The law affords you the opportunity to present your reasons for your actions in your defense.
A criminal assault occurs when a person has been placed in reasonable, immediate fear of bodily harm by the conduct of another. An assault is accompanied with force or violence to inflict bodily harm on another or engage in some offensive conduct. A criminal battery is defined as the unlawful touching or striking of another by the aggressor himself, or by some object put in motion by him. A battery is done with the intention of bringing about a harmful or offensive contact which is not legally consented to by the other and not otherwise privileged.
Oftentimes, criminal charges for assault and battery are the result of one person's story. Unfortunately, that one side of the story does not always represent the truth. The law says you are innocent until proven guilty, but if you are not familiar with the law you might not know how to put forth your defense. You need an experienced criminal lawyer to fight for you and tell your side of the story.
Your lawyers at Axelrod & Associates, P.A. in Myrtle Beach know what evidence the court may accept and what defenses could beat the crimes of assault and battery.

These Were the Top 5 News Stories in Halton for 2018

The year 2018 was a busy one in terms of news for the Halton Region.
We welcomed a lot of new restaurants and stores, and said goodbye to some gems, there was a municipal election, and ... well you get it, a lot happened in Halton during 2018.
These, however, were the top five news stories in Halton for 2018.
5. The Status of the Glen Abbey Golf Course in Oakville
The future of Oakville's Glen Abbey Golf Course has been in question since 2015 when a pre-hearing meeting was held with ClubLink.
In September of last year, inhalton.com reported that ClubLink was filing an application to remove and demolish Oakville's beloved Glen Abbey Golf Course and all buildings on the land - aside from the ones covered under the redevelopment proposal.
ClubLink has proposed a mixed complex which includes 3,222 residential units, 121,000 square feet of commercial space and roughly 124 acres of permanent, and a publicly-accessible green space.
In efforts to save the golf course, town council designated Glen Abbey as a property of cultural heritage value or interest on Dec. 20, 2017.
However, the town's plan to save the golf course has reached a bump in the road.
A recent decision issued by Justice Morgan of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice has quashed the town's Cultural Heritage Landscape Conservation Plan and the associated by-laws for Glen Abbey.
This decision is being reviewed by ClubLink.
According to the Town of Oakville's website, a further pre-hearing conference on the development applications will take place on Nov. 15, 2019
The town's website also notes, "The Local Planning Appeal Tribunal (LPAT) has scheduled the hearing regarding the Glen Abbey development applications for July 6 to Nov. 20, 2020."
4. The Legalization of Cannabis
The legalization of Cannabis has been a hot topic in Halton, and across the country, long before it was legalized on Oct. 17, 2018.
Topics of discussion have ranged from who should be allowed to use it, where should people be allowed to use it, and, as of recently, where should Halton residents be able to get it.
The discussion of retail cannabis stores has become a popular one.
Since cannabis was legalized in Canada, Ontario chose to allow recreational cannabis to be sold online through the Ontario Cannabis Store and in privately operated retail stores.
The location and operation of these private stores will be under the control of the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO). This private retail model is set to launch on April 1, 2019.
However, the province is allowing municipalities to make a one-time decision to opt-out of having these stores.
This decision must be made by Jan. 22, 2019.
Municipalities that opt-in to allowing retail cannabis stores will not have the option to opt out later, however, they will get funding in order to assist with the legalization of cannabis.
On the other hand, municipalities that choose to not allow retail stores may opt in later but will not be eligible for funding.
The Town of Milton has decided to opt out of having retail cannabis stores for now, and Burlington, Oakville, and Halton Hills have yet to decide.
3. The City of Burlington Elects a New Mayor
On Oct. 22, 2018, the City of Burlington elected a new mayor - Marianne Meed Ward.
She received 23,360 votes, or 46.04 per cent.
Meed Ward had previously outlined her main priorities as mayor on her website.
They are as follows:
Priority One: Reasonable Growth, Not Overdevelopment
Meed Ward is aiming to amend the current downtown plan and remove up to 30 more high-rises, and end overdevelopment across the city by sticking to zoning.
Priority Two: Get Traffic Moving and Improve Transit
Meed Ward wants to keep traffic moving in the city. In order to do this, she plans to do this by improving traffic synchronization and intersections, transit routes, implementing free seniors fares, and no bike lane road diets.
Priority Three: Reducing Flood Risks
In order to reduce flood risks in the city, Meed Ward is planning to create more building setbacks, ending lot-line to lot-line hard surface coverage, keep water at source with greenspace, and infrastructure.
Priority Four: Reducing Tax Increases
In order to achieve this, Meed Ward will be focusing on residents priorities, cutting redundant administration, better business desirability, investing in snow clearing, bylaw enforcement, road repair, as well as family and seniors amenities.
Priority Five: Rebuilding Trust and Creating an Open Government
For her last main goal, the new mayor elect is planning to focus on rebuilding the trust between city hall and the public. In order to gain residents trust, Meed Ward plans to include residents when it comes to shaping decisions. One of the main ways she plans to do this is by developing a city of Burlington Accountability portal which will feature the administrations organization structure.
2. This Halton Hills Project Was Recently Cancelled
Towards the end of the year, the Town of Halton Hills announced that the McGibbon Hotel project had been be cancelled.
In 2015, SilverCreek Commercial Builders Inc. submitted an application to amend the Town of Halton Hills Official Plan & Comprehensive Zoning By-law in order to construct a residential condominium.
After negotiations, an agreement was reached with the municipality regarding details for constructing a 10-storey, 125-unit residential condominium.
The agreement was approved by the Ontario Municipal Board.
This condominium building was to be located at 79 Main St. S. in downtown Georgetown.
Since its approval, town staff had been working with SilverCreek to move the project forward.
The reasoning for this cancellation was that the project was un-financeable. This information was revealed in a correspondence that was issued to purchasers. It has been noted that anyone who had previously purchased units will get their money back.
According to the Halton Hills official website, Buyers were provided formal notice that their Purchase Agreement was terminated and that they will receive their refunded deposits shortly by registered mail.
The news of this cancellation, and lack of communication with the town, left Mayor Rick Bonnette quite upset.
Im extremely disappointed, Mayor Bonnette said in a press release.
There was no discussion with the Town prior to the notice going out to the buyers and being made public.
Currently, the town is not aware of any future plans regarding this project but if the project were to be sold, Mayor Bonnette said, in a press release, that the town would work towards attracting another developer.
1. Two Children Injured in Elementary School Stabbing in Milton
On Sept. 5, 2018, two youths were taken to a hospital following an alleged stabbing at a Milton elementary school.
One suspect was in custody.
Halton police said officers investigated an altercation between youths that took place at Tiger Jeet Singh Elementary School (650 Yates Drive in Milton).
Police said that at 3:35 p.m. on Wednesday, Sept. 5, officers responded to a disturbance call at the school.
According to police, several youths were involved in the fight.
Two youths reportedly received injuries when a knife was used during the incident.
Police said the two victims were transported to hospital with non-life threatening injuries.
A suspect was arrested and a weapon was recovered.
Police said the youths involved in the altercation were known to each other.
There was no threat to public safety and lock down procedures were not applicable.

It's Not Paranoia
By Paige Richmond
by PAIGE RICHMOND & r & & r & & lt;span class= & quot;dropcap & quot; & "I & lt;/span & do sometimes feel like I'm not taken seriously by other bands," says Chloa Mardis, lead singer of Lousville-based soul-punk band Anton Mink. "But honestly, I don't care."
That Mardis would feel disregarded is surprising, because Anton Mink's music demands respect. Take the song "Unhappy," off the band's self-titled, self-released debut album: It boldly begins with a single guitar chord followed by a thick bass line. Then the drums crash in, creating the song's musical backbone, but it's not until Mardis starts singing that "Unhappy" sounds complete. Her throaty vocals growl over the bass dominating the song, begging for attention -- which for Mardis, 28, is the root of her problem.
As the female front-woman for an all-male band, she knows she's not getting the respect she deserves.
"I've noticed here that a band will come out, it's all guys, it's fine, it's normal," she says. "If we come out, we're automatically a female-fronted band."
What Mardis faces is a typical problem for female lead singers. While the novelty of having a woman up front gains attention for the band -- think of Gwen Stefani from ska-punk outfit No Doubt, to whom Mardis laments she is often compared -- it also becomes the band's calling card. Rather than being recognized as a great singer or talented songwriter, Mardis is a memorable musician because, well, she's a girl.
A native Kentuckian, Mardis never intended to join an all-male band; she just wanted more creative control over her music. She started out in the Louisville scene by laying vocal tracks for underground hip-hop artists and dancing at local hip-hop events, where she pop-and-locked. But she was always frustrated working with DJs because she had little musical input.
"You only get to write so much of the hook," she says. "So what I wanted to do is find a kind of music I could sing with, so I could write [my own] lyrics."
Three years ago, she answered an ad in a local newspaper from a band looking for a singer, and she found bass player Anton Z. The pair began playing acoustic sets together around Louisville with a just a bass and vocals. They recorded a few of these songs, like "Stump Her Clock," where Mardis croons over a funk-inspired bass line, channeling the jazz singers (like Nina Simone) she idolizes. She sings about markedly feminine things, like being approached by a man at a party: "Went to a party / Wasn't there for a while / When this little boy told me that he liked my smile."
Although Anton Mink gained notice around Louisville for these acoustic sets -- "It was an angle, the rock band without the guitar," says Mardis -- the band remained on the back burner while Anton played in other bands and Mardis kept dancing. When Mardis injured her back and wrist in a car wreck two years ago and could no longer dance, she decided to focus on the band. She quickly found drummer Gerome Smith, and Anton Mink recorded its first album a year ago. In April of this year, the band added guitarist Andy Jack. The band's sound is a catchier, more even-keeled version of the three-piece punk outfit the Gossip: Mardis' voice is honed and controlled, just as soulful but more steady than the Gossip's outspoken front-woman Beth Ditto.
Despite Anton Mink's other accomplishments, like creating record label Rose Island in order to self-release the band's first album, Mardis says her gender never goes unnoticed or unmentioned when Anton Mink plays shows. In fact, she'd say it's an issue "all the time." A thin, tattooed blonde, Mardis claims she's been taken advantage of when it comes time for club owners to pay for gigs.
That part of the problem, she admits, comes from the Louisville scene, where indie rock bands like Anton Mink aren't highly regarded. "The biggest band to come out of Louisville in a while is My Morning Jacket," she says, referring to the country-infused indie band fronted by Jim James. "When they first started out here, nobody even went to their shows. There were like two people there."
Even though the Louisville scene is tough, Mardis succeeds in the man's world of rock music because she can act like a man. She does all the booking and promotions for Anton Mink, including sending out demos to radio stations and record labels. While she admits an affinity for singers like Amy Winehouse, her main vocal inspiration comes from male singers like the Doors' Jim Morrison and the Misfits' Glenn Danzig. She writes take-crap-from-no-one lyrics on songs like "Monster Trucks": "No longer an amusement / You're wasting my time / You can move on / Already said goodbye." Her voice is sexy and throaty but also more masculine: She holds a deeper tone and strings her words together quickly, losing the slow melodic drawl that makes vocalists like Billie Holliday sound feminine.
What makes Mardis' vocals so powerful is the drive behind them: Listen closely to her lyrics and the female angst becomes clear. On the track "Everything," she laments feeling trapped, possibly by odds stacked against her as a female musician, "It's not paranoia / And there's no one to console ya." Consolation or not, this is one front-woman who won't fade into the background.
Anton Mink at Brooklyn Nights on Friday, Nov. 16, at 9 pm. $5. 835-4177.

DMS Students at the Melbourne Campus Get Creative
Posted on July 27, 2016 on Seahawk Nation
Melbournes Diagnostic Medical Sonography students are studying cross sectional anatomy. In order to help them understand the relationship of organs to one another, the students spent an afternoon creating slices of the human body out of play-doh.

Mrs. Percy and Mr. Williams believed in me. They were more than instructors, they tried to get to know you as a person and tried to understand your goals so they could push you towards them. And Mrs. Crawford from student services helped me find a job before I even graduated. She was dedicated to my overall success.
Jessica Kircher
Going to Keiser University was one of the greatest experiences in my life. All of my deans, professors, and staff made me feel that I was a part of something very special, and I am. I would recommend for anyone to get their education at Keiser University.
Belinda Haney
The two instructors that have impacted my life are Mr. Williams and Mrs. Percy. Both of them believed in my ability to become a great graphic designer, regardless of how I felt about my skills. I appreciate their motivation to get me to where I am today.
Justin Pugh
Beyond the curriculum of the courses, the lessons the instructors have taught me have paid dividends in my real work experiences. How to respond to criticisms, project and time management, interview skills, the list goes on and on. At the end of the day, they not only showed me how to design, but they taught me how to be a professional.
Ryan Bushey
If not for my education at Keiser I probably would not be where I am today, in both life and career. It is because of going to Keiser and the instructors I had that I joined a club started by Mr. Williams, The Lakeland Shooters Photography Group, which allowed me to venture into an amazing and very creative field that I use to enhance all aspects of my life.
Anthony Sassano
The Design program at Keiser University was filled with real world learning and hands on instruction Based on the portfolio I created while a student at Keiser University, I landed a job in Graphic Design for a major online retailer immediately after graduation.
Ty Fitzgerald
The year and a half I spent in the program better prepared me for attaining a job in the fieldAs a hands-on learner, the project-centered teaching was perfect for me.
Jackson Tejada
Keiser University has given me the opportunity to embrace a career change It has opened the door for a timely graduation and quick return to the work force
Dale Caverly
Without the education I received at Keiser University, I would not be where I am today!
Meisha Ebanks, R.N.
I not only received an excellent education but also encouragement and training that built my self-confidence every day.
Nidia Barrios
I realize the amount of knowledge I gained and feel that the educational experiences have developed me in to a person who can move higher up the career ladder.
Carlos Ramirez Flores
Keiser Universitys MBA program has renewed my mind, changed the way I think, and given me a new sense of purpose. The professors transformed my attitude and behavior, gave me the self-confidence I was lacking, and restored my energy.
Connie Sue Centrella
It has been great attending and graduating from Keiser University. Because of the small class sizes, I was able to build good relationships with classmates and professors. The PA professors care very much about the progress and success of the students and have been great advisors every step of the way through the program.
Annelise Merriner, PA-C
Attending Keiser University and getting my degree was the best decision I have ever made. The small class sizes and personalized attention helped me get my degree quickly. The hands-on experience and the education landed me a job at a neighboring law firm.
Dedrick Saxon
I chose Keiser because it had everythingsmall classes, caring professors, hands-on learning, and counselors that are really there for you. I feel like Im part of a family here, not just a number.
Natalie Dou
After being denied for several promotions at my current employer, I decided that I needed to further my education. Since graduating from Keiser with my bachelors degree in Business Administration, I have been promoted and I am able to obtain positions that werent available to me before.
Laurie Williams
Keiser helped change my life by getting my education at the right school! I had been going to another school before, I dropped out because I felt that I was not getting enough information. When I found out about Keiser, I was pleased because the instructors were great.
Nadege Dor
My decision to attend Keiser University has been one of the best decisions Ive made. I chose to enroll in the Information Technology program The one-class-a-month pace helped incredibly with my self-discipline.
Marla Hadley
The BA for Business Administration at Keiser has to be one of the best in the nation. Keiser takes the basics that are taught at the Associates level and uses them to strengthen your skills and knowledge.
Vivian R. Howard, BA in Business Administration Graduate
I found that Keiser Universitys Nuclear Medicine program of advanced studies and small class size was a perfect fit. I never came across a faculty member who wasnt truly interested.

Testimonials
Our experience with Mary was top notch all the way! She is a "no nonsense" professional who pulled her weight from start to finish. We even called her unknowingly while she was on vacation and she stopped what she was doing to attend to our needs. We would recommend her very highly.

Fremont Central Park - Fremont, CA, USA Before anyone calls me irresponsible flying my UAV over a children's playground, I did make sure there weren't a lot of people on the playground and I did my best to keep my flight time above the playground as short as possible. Please note it was very hot outside that day at 90°F. Also, it was little bit past noon on a Tuesday which is before most children got out of school. If it was a weekend or late afternoon, I would not have done this.

Aerial Scenery. Upper San Leandro Reservoir. East Bay MUD Park at Valle Vista Staging Area - Moraga, CA, USA Please note that the operation of aircrafts and quadcopters are not allowed in East Bay MUD parks (at least at the time these photos were taken). I was not aware of this rule when I performed this flight and I didn't see the rule posted anywhere when I arrived at the park. Here is the entire story for that day. I saw this park and huge lake on Google Maps and thought it would be a great spot to fly. At the time, I was not aware that the "lake" is actually the Upper San Leandro Reservoir. If I had known that, I would not have done the flight. I also saw that it was not a East Bay Regional Park, which I know has banned the operation of quadcopters and remote aircrafts. I did take a general look around after I arrived at the staging area, but didn't notice any signs that banned quadcopters so I thought I was in the clear. Around the same time, East Bay Regional Park Police and a park ranger were called in for some other stuff. Either way, they saw me bring my quadcopter into the park. I set up my quadcopter at a picnic table and waited for several minutes to see if one of them was going to come talk to me about a rule I might not have been aware of. They did eye me a few times and I eyed them a few times but they didn't come over. By that point, I thought it was fine and started my flight. It wasn't until after I finished my flight and packed away my quadcopter that a East Bay Regional Park Police officer came to talk to me. He told me that I wasn't suppose to fly my quadcopter here and said that he's letting me off with a warning. I would like to thank the ranger that day and the East Bay Regional Park Police for helping me learn the rules of the park and for being kind enough to let me off with a warning. I won't do this again in East Bay MUD parks as long as the rule is in place. With this in mind, if any one running the East Bay MUD parks, rangers, or East Bay Regional Park Police would like a copy of any of these aerial photos I took in this East Bay MUD park for publications, websites, etc..., contact me and I'd be happy to provide a high resolution copy for use as a show of gratitude. As for everyone else reading this, I would also like the following to be known. I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety issues. Getting in trouble or crashing my quadcopter is definitely not something I want or willing to do. I generally do a thorough look through of the area I'm going to be flying in on Google Maps before the flight. Sadly, Google Maps did not have the reservoir labeled at the zoom level I was at on the map. I do a detailed review of the satellite imagery of the area I'm going to be flying in before my flights to check for potential obstacles & hazards (such as high voltage power lines). I also check distances during my planning and conservatively calculate how far I'm willing to fly my quadcopter and attempt to factor in wind resistance that might be expected on the day of the flight. When I get to the area I'm going to fly in, I also spend some time looking around before the flight to check for potential obstacles. During my flights, I generally only fly forward so I can see what is in front of the quadcopter by the video feed. Now and then, I will do a 360° spin around to check for other potential obstacles. During my flight, I also keep a constant watch on my battery power, flight speed, distance, and other factors. I take many precautions before and during my flights to ensure the flight is done safely.

Aparicio-Levy Technical Center Prepares Students For Todays High Demand Jobs

Aparicio-Levy Technical Center in Tampa provides affordable programs for students who want to improve their job skills or receive training and certification for high-demand jobs available in the Tampa Bay area.
Since June of 2005, Aparicio-Levy Technical Center, a part of Hillsborough County public schools and its five campus HiTEC network, has been providing adult learners with programs that prepare students for entry level employment and courses designed to improve job skills.
Aparicio-Levy Technical Center does this in a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere using state-of-the-art equipment in a 25,000-sq.-ft. facility, located at 10119 E. Ellicott St. in Tampa.
According to AnnMarie Courtney, Principal/Administrator of Aparicio-Levy Technical Center, Our mission is: We will be valued and recognized for high expectations, industry credibility and relevant technical training. Our students will be equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to meet their goals and contribute to the continued economic growth of the great Tampa Bay area.
Aparicio-Levy Technical Center was named after Henry Aparicio, who was a beloved educator, and George Levy, a local businessman. The school serves the community by providing a strong connection between education and business. Courtney explained, Instruction is driven by the employment needs in the area. Each of our programs have a Program
Advisory Board which is made up of industry members who help guide the curriculum so that the learning is industry credible and relevant to todays workplace.
Essentially, students receive education and training in jobs and careers that are in demand in the area. Courtney stated, We are a resource for adult learners who are looking to gain new skills, improve their current skills or transition to a new career.
According to Courtney, The Industrial Graduation Percentage as reported to the Council on Occupational Education was 85.65 percent.
A complete list of programs that are offered can be found on the schools website. Adult learners can see whether a program will last a few weeks or a full year. The tuition rate for the current school year is $2.55 to $4.50 per clock hour plus fees, textbooks, materials and supplies. Financial aid is available for students who qualify.
For more information on Aparicio-Levy Technical Center, please visit www.goaltc.com or call 740-4884.

Apothic Dark
We vroegen ons al af kan het nog lekkerder na de zo succesvolle Apothic Red, nou JA is dus het antwoord! Man man het is een totaal feest met slingers ballonnen en vuurwerk deze Apothic Dark. De smaak indrukken zijn nog voller en krachtiger en donkerder. De naam Apothic Dark is hieraan afgeleid, en we kunnen stellen dat het een perfecte naam is voor deze geweldige Californische wijn. Hij is gemaakt van de druiven Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Merlot en natuurlijk Zinfandel. De druiven groeien op in de beste percelen van Apothic en worden met de hand geoogst. Hierna volgt een lange rijping in houten vaten waardoor deze Apothic Dark zijn volle en zeer zachte smaak krijgt. Het resultaat is verbluffend en geeft in de geur rijpe tonen van Zwart fruit, chocolade, mokka, toffee en vanille. De geur is zo aantrekkelijk dat deze rode wijn onweerstaanbaar is. Dit zet zich voort in de smaak deze is in de eerste aanzet zacht met rijpe fruit tonen zoals besjes, bramen en kersen. Achter op de tong proef je dikke rijkdom van pruimen, mokka, cacao, vanille en toffee. Maar wat een perfecte wijn met een zachte afdronk. Echt een aanrader en deze Apothic Dark wordt bekroond met vele wijnprijzen en recensies.
Omschrijving Apothic Red
Apothic is een onderdeel van het welbekende wijnhuis Gallo uit Californië. Naast het maken van goede huiswijnen hebben zij ook nog enkele Premium series waaronder de Apothic. Ernest en Julio Gallo uit Italië hadden de wens om in Californië wijnen te maken waarmee zij een breed selectie konden maken voor de wijndrinkers. Dit is zeker gelukt! Al 3 generaties lang weten zij top wijnen te produceren die over de hele wereld bekend zijn. Apothic is een afgeleide van Apotheca, een Mysterieuze plek waar wijnboeren 800 jaar geleden hun wijn blenden. De wijnrange van Apothic is gemaakt op basis van de verhalen uit het verleden, gecombineerd met het heden. Een Mysterieuze serie met prachtige smaken. Naast de welbekende Apothic Red kunt u exclusief bij Perfectewijn ook de Apothic Dark kopen.

Apothic Red
Oei Oei, wat een heerlijke volle wijn met zachte nuances en heel veel smaken. Deze Apothic Red is een Winemakers Blend uit Californië, en hij is gemaakt van de mooie druiven Syrah, Zinfandel, Merlot en Cabernet Sauvignon. En hij kreeg maar liefst 88 PUNTEN PARKER, en dat is uniek voor deze prijs klasse. Deze rode Apothic Red heeft in de geur een prachtige aroma's van zwart fruit, chocolade, kruiden, vanille en iets van mokka en pruimen. De smaak is echt een plaatje, zo veel zachtheid is ongekend, maar ook hele volle smaken van bramen, kersen, chocolade, mokka en een kleine toon van pruimen en kruiden. Echt een aanrader deze rode wijn uit Californië Apothic Red.

Testimonials
Dirk worked on my classic BMW series 6 some years back. The most confident mechanic there is. Him & his wife are honest people.
-Rob R.
My family has been going to Pete B forever. I wouldn't trust going anywhere else. He is honest and fast. Everyone there is friendly. I don't know what else you could ask for. Highly recommend!
-Sara R.
I've had my car serviced twice and they have been wonderful. It is difficult to find an auto repair place you can trust. It helps that the owner and his wife work there so you know they care about your being happy. They know their stuff and they are honest so if you're looking for a great place to take your car, this is the best experience I've had in 7 years of living on Long Island!
-Chris T.
For the past 28 years they are the best repair shop that I've ever used. Thank you Dirk!
-Christopher M.
Dirk is the man for your air cooled needs. Been going there for years.
-Kenneth P.
Dirk and his crew are great. I took my wife's Mercedes here because of a noise I suspected of being a wheel bearing. The car had already been to two MB Dealers, both said they couldn't find anything wrong and the noise was attributed to the tires. Even when I asked them to check the bearing, they said it was fine. Dirk's guys not only agreed with the wheel bearing issue, but found because the issue was left to go so long, the hub was damaged as well. Now the car is back to riding and sounding the way it should. From now on, the car goes to Pete B for everything.
-Joseph T.

Vehicle tips
According to recent studies, 5 percent of all motor vehicle fatalities are clearly caused by automobile maintenance neglect.
The cooling system should be completely flushed and refilled about every 24 months. The level, condition, and concentration of coolant should be checked. (A 50/50 mix of anti-freeze and water is usually recommended.)
Never remove the radiator cap until the engine has thoroughly cooled. The tightness and condition of drive belts, clamps and hoses should be checked by a pro.
Change your oil and oil filter as specified in your manual, or more often (every 3,000 miles) if you make frequent short jaunts, extended trips with lots of luggage or tow a trailer.
Replace other filters (air, fuel, PCV, etc.) as recommended, or more often in dusty conditions. Get engine drivability problems (hard stops, rough idling, stalling, diminished power, etc.) corrected at a good shop.
A dirty windshield causes eye fatigue and can pose a safety hazard. Replace worn blades and get plenty of windshield washer solvent.
Have your tires rotated about every 5,000 miles. Check tire pressures once a month; let the tires cool down first. Don't forget your spare and be sure your jack is in good condition.
Check your owner's manual to find out what fuel octane rating your car's engine needs then buy it.
Keep your tires inflated to the proper levels. Under-inflated tires make it harder for your car to move down the road, which means your engine uses more fuel to maintain speed.
Lighten the load. Heavier vehicles use more fuel, so clean out unnecessary weight in the passenger compartment or trunk before you hit the road.
Use the A/C sparingly. The air conditioner puts extra load on the engine forcing more fuel to be used.
Keep your windows closed. Wide-open windows, especially at highway speeds, increase aerodynamic drag and the result is up to a 10% decrease in fuel economy.
Avoid long idling. If you anticipate being stopped for more than one minute, shut off the car. Contrary to popular belief, restarting the car uses less fuel than letting it idle.
Stay within posted speed limits. The faster you drive, the more fuel you use. For example, driving at 65 miles per hour (mph) rather than 55 mph, increases fuel consumption by 20 percent.
Use cruise control. Using cruise control on highway trips can help you maintain a constant speed and, in most cases, reduce your fuel consumption.
Keep your engine tuned. A fouled spark plug or plugged/restricted fuel injector can reduce fuel efficiency as much as 30 percent.
Inspect the engine's belts regularly. Look for cracks or missing sections or segments. Worn belts will affect the engine performance.
Have the fuel filter changed every 10,000 miles to prevent rust, dirt and other impurities from entering the fuel system.
Change the transmission fluid and filter every 15,000 to 18,000 miles. This will protect the precision-crafted components of the transmission/transaxle.
Inspect the suspension system regularly. This will extend the life of the vehicle's tires.

How will you use your glasses?
Distance
£10
Single Vision For Distance
Single Vision for Distance
Correct poor vision with distance viewing lenses designed specifically for the short-sighted. SpecsatHome distance lenses are defined by a single dioptric feature, which runs through the lens. These exceptionally flat, lightweight lenses look great and deliver perfect vision  whatever the strength of your prescription. Enjoy crystal clear vision and comfort with a lens designed for your needs.
VDU
£10
Intermediate For VDU
Intermediate for VDU
With visual zones tailored to the movements of the eyes, this SpecsatHome lens offers a wide range of vision at close and intermediate distances. Perfect for those who work with VDUs or spend a lot of time looking at computer or mobile phone screens, they provide optimum vision when it really matters. For those who require intermediate lenses for work, this lens will significantly enhance your vision while ensuring the posture of your head and neck is not strained. VDU lenses are available in a range of strengths to provide near, room, book and individual vision solutions.
Reading
£10
Near Vision For Reading
Near Vision for Reading
Prescription lenses for the long-sighted. SpecsatHome reading glasses deliver perfect sight  right to the edge of the lens. Available in a range of prescription strengths, these lenses will ensure you can enjoy reading everything from books, smallprint, menus, price tags and a lot more. Slightly thicker at the edge than our lenses for distance viewing, these single vision lenses offer great value, convenience and comfort.
Bifocal
£40
Bifocal
Bring your world into focus with SpecsatHome bifocal lenses. Our multifocal lenses require two prescriptions. One aids distance viewing and is located at the top of the glasses and the other delivers perfect near viewing from the bottom. The two lens types in bifocal glasses are defined by a curve or dividing line on the lens. We dispense four types of bifocal lenses  C Segment, Round Segment, Executive and D Segment. The shape of your lens will be dictated by your visual needs as well as the demands of your work and personal lifestyle.
Occupational
£69
Occupational
SpecsatHome occupational lenses help you carry on doing the things you love without compromising your posture or straining your eyes. Whether you need glasses to cope with the demands of an office environment or for a hobby, such as DIY, handicrafts or gardening, these lenses provide a greater range of vision than single vision lenses. They offer either intermediate and close-up or distance viewing. Occupational lenses deliver perfect vision for those who need to perform multiple tasks. This means your vision remains crystal clear even if you switch from looking at a computer screen to paperwork. These lenses are often prescribed to help wearers retain good posture and avoid headaches and migraines.
Standard Varifocal
£50
Standard Varifocal
Our standard varifocal lens lets you see objects that are either close or in the distance  without straining your eyes. Providing all-round vision, these lenses will not blur distances between objects. Unlike bifocal lenses, which are made up of two prescription strengths, there is no visible line on the surface of the lens to determine the varying prescription powers used. Each of our standard varifocal lenses is made up of more than two parts. The top part of the lens helps you see things clearly from a distance. The strength of the prescription is then increased, according to your individual needs, providing perfect vision at middle distances and for near distance reading.
Premium Varifocal
£100
Premium Varifocal
SpecsatHome premium varifocal lenses are designed to fit a larger range of frames than our standard varifocal lenses. They offer wider fields of crystal clear vision for both intermediate and distance viewing. Many people who need glasses find premium varifocals easier to adapt to than the standard version. They provide outstanding distance viewing and very good midrange and near vision. With more than two prescription powers, our premium varifocal lenses give you the vision you need from multiple viewing distances.
Bespoke Varifocal

Essilor X Series
£275

About Dunegrass Inn
*We are happy to say that Dunegrass inn was not damaged by Hurricane Michael. The nearby Boardwalk community pool is back in service and beach access is also restored to it's pre-storm status.
Located in the coveted Boardwalk Community of Cape San Blas, pet-friendly Dunegrass Inn is a lovely three-bedroom, three-bath home which features stunning views. With plenty of room for six and a short walk to the beach, Dunegrass Inn is ideal for family vacations or multiple-couple beach getaways. Guests can spend their days strolling along the boardwalk, having a swim in the community pool, or taking a horseback ride along the beach.
With clean lines and an open floor plan, this well-appointed home is bright an airy; making it conducive for gathering together as a group. The fully-equipped kitchen has everything you could possibly need to prepare a gourmet meal for a crowd, including ample counter-space, stainless-steel appliances, seating for three at the breakfast bar and another six at the table in the dining area.
The wall-mounted, flat-screen TV in the living room offers Netflix, Amazon Prime video and music and local stations. With seating for eight, theres plenty of room to get comfortable and enjoy the show. There is a queen-sized bedroom on this level, which features a private balcony with hammock and outdoor chairs. The second bedroom comes replete with a king-sized bed and a flat-screen TV. Two spacious full-bathrooms are also located on this level.
Downstairs, you will find a sitting room with a plush queen-sized sofa bed, as well as a concrete patio with a new fish cleaning station, so that you can clean your catch before preparing it on the charcoal grill.
We welcome your dog for an additional $115 fee, all dogs must be under 25lbs. If you have a larger dog or other type of pet, please call and speak with us before booking to make a special request. No events with a higher number of guests than the occupancy of the house are permitted and there is a minimum age requirement of 25 for renters.
Your reservation includes $250 worth of beach gear. That's right! Rent a beach wagon, beach chairs, umbrellas, paddle boards, and more for your stay. Your $250 credit will go a long way!
In addition to the free Beach Gear, we have another gift for booking through usfree admission to Cape San Blas activities! Termed the Xplorie Program, our guests will receive one free adult admission ticket, per night stayed, to attractions like chartered fishing, golf and horseback riding on the beach. Its our way of saying thanks!

Scholarships for
Art Students
Through 2017 and beyond, The Art Career Project will be awarding creators, makers, and emerging artists with scholarships, grants, and start-up capital to help fund their education, start a new business, or pursue the artistic careers of their dreams. Whether you are a student, entrepreneur, or experienced artist, we want to support you.
A degree from a typical four-year college or university can be expensive. Many students, even with help from their parents, are unable to cover the costs of education by paying out of pocket. To pay for school, art students must research and apply for various forms of financial aid. Knowing the differences between the many forms of financial aid, how to apply for financial aid, and which types of financial aid are best can help students make smart financial decisions before entering college. Explore our featured resources here.

The Media's Golf Double Standard
The president has gone golfing more than hes met the press. Had Bush tried that, hed have been clubbed by the media. Mark McKinnon on Washingtons 18-hole hypocrisy.
Mark McKinnon
04.21.10 1:11 PM ET
News flash: President Obama hasnt held a formal press conference in almost a year (274 days and counting) yet has golfed 32 times since he was electedeight more times than President George W. Bush did during his entire presidency.
Now personally, I think the president should golf every day and never have a press conference. I want the leader of the free world to be as stress-free as possible. And if golf helps fade the psychic heat from the job, by all means tee it up often, Mr. President. Sadly, press conferences have turned into not much more than vanity exhibitions for White House reporters who preen and exhort in front of the camerasnot to convey needed news to the public, but to make themselves seem important.
Obama was criticized by foreign press recently when he went golfing. But there was not a critical peep from the American press.
Does anyone really think that Obama has been hiding from the press? Obama has more press exposure than any president everby a long shot. He and his team have just figured out clever ways to communicate by going around the White House press corps, whose members are about as busy as the Maytag repairman these days. Theyve become glorified babysitters.
But imagine the press histrionics we would have heard if George W. Bush had gone nine months without a press conference?
Recall that Bush was loudly criticized when he didnt hold press conferences frequently enough to satiate a badgering press, though he averaged one about every two months. Over the course of his presidency, he held 45.
Bush was also constantly ridiculed and criticized for playing golf, most memorably by Michael Moore in Fahrenheit 9/11. In August 2003, Bush gave up the game, believing it sent the wrong message to grieving parents of soldiers killed or wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan. Of course, he was ridiculed for that as well.
Obama was criticized by foreign press recently when, unable to travel to pay respects to the president of Poland who was killed in a plane crash, he went golfing.
But there was not a critical peep from the American press.
On Memorial Day last year, the press reverently reported that Obama placed a wreath on the Tomb of the Unknowns in the morning, and then observed a moment of silence that afternoonon the golf course before teeing off. (I can only imagine how this would have been reported if Bushs moment of silent remembrance and solemn prayer was on the green.)
And heres how ABC reported an outing after Obama had just returned from a trip to Germany visiting the horror of the Holocaust camps: Nobody would fault Obama for taking Sunday to catch up on sleep and unwind after the breakneck travel schedule. But instead of vegging out on the couch, Obama returned to the White House for only about 90 minutes, then hopped in his motorcade and went right back to Andrews to get in nine holes of golf at one of the three courses on the base.
And how about this headline from The Washington Post:  Just the Sport for a Leader Most Driven. Richard Leiby reports, To some, Obamas frequent outings reflect a cool self-confidence. The article then quotes a sports psychologist who said Obama seemed able to play golf despite the grim reports by the media about the wars and the economy.
That bears repeating. Here is a journalist remarking about Obama that he is able to play golf despite war casualties and economic disaster. For Bush, the press couldnt believe that he would dare golf at such a time, but for Obama they marvel that he can.
Now thats a double standard that unfortunately weve come to expect. When it comes to press coverage of Bush vs. Obama, its become par for the course.
As vice chairman of Public Strategies and president of Maverick Media, Mark McKinnon has helped meet strategic challenges for candidates, corporations and causes, including George W. Bush, John McCain, Governor Ann Richards, Charlie Wilson, Lance Armstrong, and Bono.

How Clint Eastwood Bonds With His 64-Year-Old Love Child Who Tracked Him Down

Legendary actor Clint Eastwood, who was tracked down by his biological daughter 15 years ago, is said to share a special relationship with her and his newfound extended family including a lookalike grandson.
Over a decade ago, mother of two Laurie Murray, now 64, decided it was time to execute the search for her biological parents. Murray, who was placed for adoption at birth and adopted by a couple in Seattle, received incredible news from Eastwood biographer Patrick McGilligan that her biological mother (whose name has not been revealed) had been connected to the then-unknown actor Clint Eastwood. In fact, McGilligan discovered that Eastwood and Murray's biological mother were involved in a serious relationship while the actor was engaged to Maggie Johnson, his first wife. When the original adoption documents were found, Murray's biological mother had written down Eastwood's name as the father. Imagine Murray's shock and surprise when it was revealed that the Hollywood star actually was her biological father!
According to Daily Mail, sources close to the Eastwood family say that the actor received the news well and according to one family friend, Eastwood didn't seem to even know that Murray's biological mother was pregnant at the time. The reunited father and daughter have shared a special relationship over the years, building a bond over their mutual love of golf and the great outdoors.
While it is said that Murray's biological mother was contacted but expressed her wish not to communicate, Eastwood is said to have stepped into the father role to Murray exceptionally well and is a good grandfather to Murray's two grown children, Lowell Thomas IV ("LT" for short) and Kelsey. Eastwood attended both LT and Kelsey's weddings and is said to have even hosted Kelsey's wedding at a resort that he owns in California. While Murray has a clear resemblance to her natural father, it's grandson LT who looks strikingly similar to the actor as well as Eastwood's 32-year-old son, actor Scott Eastwood. Neither Eastwood or Murray responded to Daily Mail when they reached out for a comment but LT replied, "All I would say is that hes been a great father to my mom, and always great to me and my family whenever we see him."
RELATED: CELEBRITIES YOU'D NEVER EXPECT GAVE UP A CHILD FOR ADOPTION
dailymail.co.uk
In fact, Murray's family is said to have flown on the Warner Brothers' jet with their famous relative, gone on skiing and Hawaiian vacations together as well as spending a few holidays together.
Even though Eastwood and Murray reunited several years ago, it wasn't made public knowledge that the actor had met his long lost daughter until earlier this week when Murray joined Eastwood's seven other children at the premiere of their father's latest movie, The Mule. Photographers incorrectly listed Murray's name as "Laurie Eastwood" which sent the online world atwitter with curiosity when the photo was released on Monday. The family friend has also revealed that Murray is a very private person and never boasts to anyone that her father is Clint Eastwood.
"Laurie is a very nice woman and very private," the source said. "She definitely doesn't go around telling people this. Laurie and her family are wealthy in their own right... She never goes by Laurie Eastwood... So it wasn't a situation, which I'm sure someone like Clint Eastwood is used to, of someone crawling out of the woodwork looking for money."
dailymail.co.uk
The Mule movie premiere certainly isn't the first time that Murray has attended Hollywood events with her famous father so it's unclear how or why she hasn't been mentioned before in the Hollywood gossip circle. In 2004, Murray attended the Oscars show with her father, Eastwood's second wife, Dina, now 53, and the actor's mother, Ruth Wood. They were all photographed together on the red carpet.
"We always wondered why it was never really widely known or widely acknowledged before," the family friend said. "He took Laurie to the Oscars around the time that he was nominated for Mystic River with his mom and Dina. Laurie had a really great relationship with Clint's mom. It seems to be a close relationship and they are together fairly often."
As for how the other 7 Eastwood siblings have taken to the news of their newfound sister over the years, certain Instagram posts have made it clear that Murray is most definitely considered a sibling.
"SO RARE for all 8 Eastwood siblings to be in one room!!!" Eastwood's youngest child, 22-year-old daughter, Morgan wrote next to a photo of the sibling group on Instagram.
"I'm not sure there has ever been a picture of all 8 kids together but here it is," Eastwood's daughter, actress Alison, captioned the same photo.

Perfect holiday villa
Reviewed 2 January 2013 for a stay in December 2012
Fantastic holiday villa. Isabel was so pleasant and easy going. The villa itself had all the amenities you would expect from your own home and was finished to an extremely high standard. Extremely child friendly too. Location was perfect - right beside the supermarket, a stones throw (literally 2 mins stroll) to the prom, less than 15 mins stroll to the marina.
I couldn't recommend Isabel and her Villa highly enough.

Data is the linchpin in your ability to make in-the-moment competitive decisions, increase efficiency, and identify new market and customer opportunities. But, if youre like most companies, 80% of your data is unstructured and file-based, and cannot be analyzed with traditional relational database tools.
With Unisys, you can marry subject matter experts with data scientists, and use machine learning to run real-time predictive algorithms to be more competitive in the marketplace while generating more revenue per customer at a lower cost.

Using as little as 2 gallons-per-minute (gpm) at normal water pressure (50 psi), even under high pressure (80 psi), the DS-series will utilize no more than 2.5 gpm while still providing the perfect shower feel. Its standard 1/2 female thread installs easily on any standard shower arm, and an optional push-button control allows for easy adjustment of shower force or a quick flowrate-cut for greater water savings in an instant. Whedon DS-series showerheads provide powerful and invigorating shower flow without excessive water usage. Superior showerhead design increases water velocity even in low water pressure situations, offering a conical spray that is neither too sharp nor too misty.
The Whedon DS Brushed Nickel showerhead fits all standard American plumbing
35 degrees omnidirectional adjustments
No tool installation for easy set-up

A tee shot straight up the hill must be kept to the left of the mounds for a clear shot at the green. The second shot is made much more difficult with some massive bunkers in front of the green and a small pot bunker off to the right.
Once on the green it doesnt get any easier with an uneven slope running through the centre of the green.

Beyoncé Saw Dear Evan Hansen on Broadway, and the Cast Had a Meltdown

No longer will the cast of Dear Evan Hansen be left tap, tap, tapping on the glass to get Beyoncé's attention, because the singer, apparently, is far from immune to the charms of America's favorite 17-year-old socially awkward compulsive liar. That's right: Beyoncé took a break from raising her three-month-old twins Rumi and Sir Carter to attend Thursday night's performance of the hit Broadway musicaland the cast reacted in an appropriately dramatic manner.
Several of the Tony Award-sweeping show's performers documented the life-changing moment on social media. Ben Platt, who plays the titular high schooler, posted a sweet photo on Twitter in which he clutches his hands to his chest and exchanges fawning looks with Beyoncé backstage after the show. "It happened," he captioned the pic, which you can bet is already in the process of being blown up and framed at the Kinko's nearest New York City's Music Box Theatre. Platt also posted the photo on Instagram with an alternate caption: "The alien called me an alien and I'm no longer living."
Kristolyn Lloyd and Laura Dreyfuss, who play Evan's classmate and love interest, respectively, both shared a group shot of the entire cast crowding around Bey, all looking as thrilled as someone who just found same-day Dear Evan Hansen tickets for less than $600 on Stubhub. "Hi I met Her. K bye," Lloyd wrote on Instagram. "I'm not okay," Dreyfuss captioned the photo, before tweeting the same sentiment for good measure. Lloyd also shared a video on Twitter of her cast mates crying and having a collective heart attack in "the aftermath" of Beyoncé's surprise backstage visit. Words fail, indeed.
This isn't the first time the singer has caused mayhem on Broadway. In 2015, at the height of Hamilton's (still extremely high) popularity, Beyoncé paid that Tony Award-winning cast a backstage visit after an October show. In a series of tweets afterwards, the musical's creator and star Lin-Manuel Miranda shared that Bey had showered praise on Jonathan Groff, who originally played the laughably pompous King George in the show. "I'm stealing your walk. I love your walk," she reportedly said, adding, "When you turned away still facing the audience? You were your OWN turntable. Love it."
It's anyone's guess what tidbit Beyoncé will be borrowing from Dear Evan Hansen, but perhaps an influx of blue-striped polo shirts and plaster casts into her wardrobe, and a moving remix of "You Will Be Found" on her next album.

Area Info: Mijas Pueblo
Breathtaking Vistas
Official figures show that 12 million tourists currently visit the Costa del Sol every year. Clearly, each area on the Coast is keen to play host to as many of these visitors as possible  but some are better equipped than others. One of them is Mijas Pueblo, which has a highly tangible tourist presence all year round.
More on Mijas Pueblo
Enlarge Map
Mijas laidback beauty, sublime climate and magnificent views create an atmosphere that is best accompanied by a glass of chilled wine
At first glance, this might paint Mijas as a caricature of the classic whitewashed pueblo, but the town has much more to offer than a picture-postcard setting, breathtaking vistas and shops selling tourist trinkets and ornaments.
In an architectural and cultural sense, Mijas strikes just the right balance between tourist destination and residential functionality. Located just inland from Fuengirola, the town is highly accessible and amazingly picturesque, proving particularly popular with older tourists and homebuyers.
It is not hard to understand why: the towns laidback beauty, sublime climate and magnificent views create an atmosphere that is best accompanied by a glass of chilled wine, a dusky horizon and the relaxing orchestral sounds of local wildlife, calling time on another day in paradise.
Other-Worldly Silence
During the winding climb to Mijas from Fuengirola, you experience many changes in just six kilometres. Most noticeably, the hustle and bustle of the coast fades to a distant hum, while the roadside gives way to rockier outcrops as you ascend the side of one of the Costa del Sol's numerous peaks.
Entering Mijas, the blinding whiteness of the alabaster-pale buildings is a striking sight, especially when the searing sun is at its highest. Cafés, bars, restaurants and gift shops compete for your attention, yet it is the authentic beauty of the religious shrine, perched on its own rocky pedestal, that first draws the eye.
Classic whitewashed village... with traditional horse carriage rides
Gorgeous views of the coastline can be enjoyed from pretty much every vantage point in town, with the other-worldly silence of the mountainside providing an effective sound barrier.
Mijas's location makes it a favoured weekend retreat for many locals from the coast, while the short drive to the airport means it is an appealing destination for expats seeking a peaceful and convenient area to purchase their dream home in the sun.
Peaceful street life in Mijas
Day-Time Pursuits and Evening Pleasures
The cultural wealth of Mijas is evident from the moment you first set foot outside and into the ephemeral sunlight. Ignoring the views  which is difficult  Mijas's beauty lies in its quaintness. Its compact size and hilly location posed challenges for architects many centuries ago, but the result is spectacular.
Charming traditional touches blending with modern living
Tiny square houses cling to the landscape like fluff on a sweater, creating a backdrop of scattered, whitewashed walls and red-tiled roofs that looks great on a postcard.
Around the central square there are cafés with excellent menú del día offerings that, while ostensibly aimed at tourists, are great value and attract locals, expats and visitors alike. The old bullring is one of the most captivating in Andalucía, while equally diverting is the Mijas Wine Museum, with its daily tastings and the chance to learn all about Mijas's small but growing wine industry.
Enriching Cultural Experiences
Once suitably imbibed, a trip to the Casa Museo is an enriching experience, where you can discover the town's Roman roots, agricultural past and recent boom as one of southern Europes iconic tourist destinations. The towns commercial centre has boutiques, jewellery stores and restaurants, in addition to banks, grocery stores and pharmacies.
Handily for expats, the town hall has its own Foreigners Department, where non-Spanish speakers can request assistance and advice in their own languages. Once the paperwork has been filled in, the children packed off to school, the local doctor met and the food shopping completed, Mijas's stunning gardens will beckon you, serenaded by birdsong while enjoying the welcome sunshine and pervading sense of peace.
Laidback life in Mijas mountains
For evening pleasures, Mijas hosts a diverse array of festivals and events during the year, showcasing music, drama, art, handicrafts and gastronomy.
The sparkling runway of lights that forms the backbone of the Costa del Sol twinkles spectacularly below, enticing walkers out on to Mijas's pristine streets for a night-time stroll; while the inviting cosiness of the many bars and cafés dotting the town proves irresistible, transforming its daytime tranquillity into a more social ambience in the evening.
The absence of nightclubs is explained by the town's proximity to Fuengirola, ensuring the weekend diaspora of younger folk leave Mijas free to be enjoyed by those seeking a more sedate and leisurely evening  where the wine flows as freely as the contented smiles.

Alliance Bank Visa Infinite Business Credit Card review
What's so good (or not so good) about it?
Cashback or Reward Points
Alliance Bank Visa Infinite Business Credit Card allows you to make choices on whether to earn cashback or reward points. Every Ringgit you spend on retail purchases is worthy with both options.
If you are in favour of cashback benefit, you can earn 0.2% cashback for purchases of up to RM10000. Yes, there's no minimum purchase required. If you spend between RM10001 and RM200000, you can enjoy 0.5% cashback, meanwhile, the cashback is 0.8% for the spending between RM200001 to RM300000. If you spend more than that, you can earn the highest cashback rate of 1.5%. However, the maximum cashback is capped at retail purchases of RM650000 per month. That simply means the maximum monthly cap is RM9750.
On the other hand, you can opt for Timeless Bonus Points (TBP) with no expiry date. For every Ringgit you spend on retail purchases locally, you can earn 1x Timeless Bonus Point. Besides that, you can earn double TBP for your retail purchases at overseas. Bear in mind that petrol and government-related expenses will not be rewarded with Timeless Bonus Points.
0% Interest Instalment
For your overseas business spending, you can opt to repay with zero interest with 0% Alliance Bank Business Credit Card FlexiPay Plan, provided that you are able to settle the outstanding dues in 3 months. The minimum spending required is RM500.
If you would like to pick longer repayment periods, you can opt for a 6-month repayment plan with the one-time upfront handling fee of 2.5%. Besides that, you can stretch your business spending repayment to 12 months with the one-time interest rate of 5.5% on the FlexiPay amount. The minimum purchase amount is RM500.
The one-time upfront interest rate will be charged on the first instalment month. Despite the FlexiPay Plan's low interest rate, it's better to make the repayment on time. Otherwise, Alliance Bank will charge you 18%p.a. on the outstanding monthly instalment or the entire amount, depending on the decision from Alliance Bank.
Eligibility
You can apply for the Alliance Bank Visa Infinite Business Credit Card with 2 options - personal or business liability. If you choose to bundle the credit card with personal liability, the minimum annual income is RM150000 and you're required to operate your business for at least 2 years. For business liability, on the other hand, the minimum annual turnover is higher at RM500000 with minimum 3 years' business operation.
The Personal Liability Visa Infinite Business Credit Card gives you the minimum credit limit of RM30000 for up to RM300000. Meanwhile, the credit limit falls between RM25000 and RM500000 for the credit card with company liability.
Last but not least, the credit limit is subjected to credit evaluation and your repayment capacity.
