Benefits of Massage Therapy
Massage therapy as a healing tool has been around for thousands of years in many cultures. Touching is a natural human reaction to pain and stress as well as for conveying compassion and support. We now have scientific proof of the benefits of massage therapy. These benefits range from treating chronic diseases and injuries to alleviating the growing tensions of our modern lifestyles. Receiving massage therapy does more than relax your body and mind, there are physiological and even psychological changes that occur even more so when massage therapy is utilized as part of a regular preventative wellness plan rather than a luxury. Massages not only feel wonderful but they can also help cure what ails you;
increased circulation
increased joint mobility
boost immunity
increase body awareness
improve range of motion
reduces risk of injury
reduces recovery time after injury/surgery
release endorphines
Massage therapy is an excellent addition to a pain management plan for those who suffer from chronic pain and other medical conditions such as;
carpal tunnel
frozen shoulder
plantar fasciitis
whiplash
sciatica
arthritis
tension headaches
TMJ disfunction
tennis elbow
stress
depression and anxiety
high blood pressure
constipation
After the Massage
To extend the benefits of massage therapy;
drink water throughout the day
stretching/yoga
exercise
eat lite, natural foods
For general wellness/maintenance we recommend massage every 4 weeks.

Seventeen lands in Manila (4 days early)
posted October 04, 2017 at 05:10 pm by Gianna G. Maniego
Popular KPop group Seventeen touched down in Manila for their concert yesterday--four days ahead of schedule.
The 13-member boy group planed in Monday afternoon from their last concert stop in Taiwan, much to the surprise of its fans, called Carats.
Seventeen--made up of SCoups, Jeonghan, Joshua, Jun, Hoshi, Wonwoo, Woozi, Minghao (The 8), Mingyu, Dokyeum, Seungkwan, Vernon and Dino--is scheduled to perform at the Mall of Asia arena on Friday, October 6.
The group, who arrived just in time to celebrate the birthday of vocal unit's Jeonghan on Wednesday, October 4, has been on its first world tour (dubbed 2017 Seventeen First World Tour Diamond Edge) since July.
Manila is the final stop on the 14-city tour, which took them to major Asian and North American pitstops, including Seoul, Saitama, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Taipei, Chicago, Dallas, New York, Toronto, and Santiago (Chile).
Seventeen: standing, from left, Dino, Seungkwan, DK, Woozi, Vernon, SCoups, Hoshi, The8, Mingyu. Squatting, from left, Jun, Jeonghan, Wonwoo and Joshua.
The concert is presented by MMI Live.
This is the second time Seventeen has visited the country. Last year, the idols stopped by Manila for a two-day fan meet, but minus two of its members. Chinese members Wen Junhui and Xu Minghao did not join due to passport issues.
This time all the members are here and the group is expected to perform on Friday as a complete unit, as promised last year by leader SCoups.
Speculation as to why the idols have flown in early has Philippine Carats on edge, so to speak. Some think the group may be possibly filming a music video or shooting a photobook in the Philippines. Others think it might be a mini vacation for Seventeen before it hunkers down for a new round of promos.
The group is scheduled to make a comeback on November 6.
Though nothing has been confirmed, one thing's undeniable--Philippine Carats are eager to see their idols perform live on Friday.
(Additional tickets to the concert, which sold out last month, are still available after MMI decided to open up more seats. So those of you who still have not gotten tickets can rush to SM Ticketnet to buy.)
Meanwhile, Seventeen just dropped the latest in the series of MV preludes to its upcoming second studio album. The latest is by the Hip Hop unit, entitled "Trauma". Earlier, Seventeen leaders SCoups, Woozi, and Hoshi unveiled their track, called "Change Up."
In the weeks running up to their comeback, more videos, this time from the Performance and Vocal units, are expected to be dropped as well.

Overview
Los Angeles punk Otto (Emilio Estevez) is headed nowhere fast until the day he meets car reposessor Bud (Harry Dean Stanton) and unwittingly becomes a repo man. Now, armed with the 'Repo Code' and on the trail of one very strange '64 Chevy Malibu, Otto is thrown into a world of nuclear weaponry, armed robbery, alien life forms, government agents and plates of shrimp. It's all a part of the most intensely hilarious cult classic of the '80s...but the life of a Repo Man is always intense.
Written and directed by Alex Cox (Sid & Nancy, Straight To Hell), Repo Man also features a landmark punk soundtrack by Iggy Pop, Black Flag, The Circle Jerks, Suicidal Tendencies, Fear, Los Plugz and more.

In August 2015, an ISIS terrorist boarded train #9364 from Brussels to Paris. Armed with an AK-47 and enough ammo to kill more than 500 people, the terrorist might have succeeded except for three American friends who refused to give in to fear. One was a college student, one was a martial arts enthusiast and airman first class in the U.S. Air Force, and the other was a member of the Oregon National Guard, and all three pals proved fearless as they charged and ultimately overpowered the gunman after he emerged from a bathroom armed and ready to kill.

About Jaclyn and Vadim
Jaclyn Linetsky
January 8, 1986 - September 8, 2003
Vadim Schneider
March 10, 1986 - September 8, 2003
Jaclyn Linetsky was a wonderful and talented actress with a constant big smile. She made different voices, including the little character Caillou between 2000 to 2002. In 2003 she obtained the role of Megan O'Connor in the new canadian tv show '15 love'.
Vadim Schneider was a charming and smiling young boy. He made various theatre, and voice work. He started in the tv show '15/Love' as Sebastien Dubé, a french young tennis player, in a tennis academy.
On September 8th 2003, after 2 months on the set, they were driven on the road to their work, when the driver lost control of the mini van and crash into a tractor trailer. The driver survive and the young promising stars died instantly. Jaclyn and Vadim were only 17.
After this, two weeks later and after their funerals, their characters in the show '15 Love' lost their lives in a plane crash after a tournament.
Everyone on the show was devastated by their death, and after there was a tremendous period of grief. They were rising stars and their talent was stellar.
No one could forget their constant big smile and their boundless happiness. The life still is hard without them...
"There's been an accident." – Curve Ball, 15/Love.
The characters, Megan and Sebastian were chosen to participate in a tennis contest in London, which makes some of the other characters jealous. After a day long tennis tournament at the school, news reaches them that Meg and Seb have been in an aviation crash, in which their were no survivors. The main characters then react in their own way to the news. The actors drawing from the deaths of Vadim Schneider and Jaclyn Linetsky, who played the characters, on the way to the set, Jackie and Vadim were involved in a car accident, when their driver lost control of the mini-van they were in, crashing into a tractor/trailer. Vadim was thrown out of the windscreen, being killed instantly, Jackie later went into cardiac arrest in an ambulance, and died. The driver was later sued.
"I have the worst news you could possibly hear"
"I have the worst news you could possibly hear"
"I have the worst news you could possibly hear"
There has been an accident.Shortly after the Hampstead tournament, a small plane went down near the Isle of White, of the coast of England. Megan and Sebastian were among the passengers, and there were no survivors.
"I'll lend you for a little time a child of mine," He said.
"For you to love while she lives and mourn for when she's dead.
She'll bring her charms to gladden you, and should her stay be brief,
You'll have her lively memory as solace for your grief."
We just wanna say that we love you and miss you very much ...
XxX
I always said you were the real star, you move like a hurricane
Through the pain
You said don't forget about me, don't forget about me
Like I'd ever forget about you
How could I just change my mind?
When all the sun shines still on you
Everyone's a lie but you're so true
You're symphonic, you're the light in the moon
How could I forget you?
You're a star, a dream that never ends, fireworks around the bend
An angel on the river Thames
You must know you're all the lights on new years eve
Quiet on the raging sea
How could I forget you?
How could I forget you?
You said don't forget about me, don't forget about me

Helping Arthur Face His Ghouls and Ghosts
Filed Under : Super Nintendo by RGB
Jun.21,2018
I can’t believe it, but it’s been 4 years since my last review of a video game. I guess I am just not that great at finishing what I start sometimes. Yet I have a review for a classic remake of a classic game – Super Ghouls and Ghosts. This is easily one of the most difficult SNES games I have ever played and one of the reasons that it took so long to do a review is because I had to really work up the courage and the discipline to get through it. Unfortunately, I was not very well rewarded with this game, but I’ll get to that later. So… here we go!

Foreword
In case you are not quite sure what this game is, it is actually a remake of a remake of remake! Yes… that’s right, third generation remake but a classic side-scrolling platformer nonetheless. To understand where this game comes from, one must understand it’s past. The game began as “Ghosts ‘n’ Goblins”, an arcade console running on the Motorola 6809 chipset in 1985. It was also released on the NES, Commodore 16, and many other game systems. Three years later, a new version of the game was created called “Ghouls ‘n’ Ghosts which was released on the Capcom System 1 (CS-1) for the arcade and on various computer consoles such as Amiga and Commodore 64. Finally, in 1991, Capcom decided to release a remastered version of the original game directly for the SNES. Hence, the game was born as a remake of a remake or a remake but it is still legendary in its style and platform skill. I should mention that the series continued and spawned many other titles including Demon’s Crest, Gargoyle’s Quest, Ultimate Ghouls ‘N’ Ghosts, etc. So despite being old enough to drink, rent a car, get married, and even start losing some hair, the series is still alive and kicking today.
Story
(( WARNING – Some Spoilers Ahead… you were warned))
Hey dude! Bring Back 2P Chains!
The story is very simple and only moderately different than the storyline from the previous games. Essentially it works like this: You are Arthur King of the Br…ahem… the Great Knight. You are in love with Princess Prin Prin (yes… that’s her freaking name… come on!) and hope to make many young Arthurs (even though the entire Arthurian legend involving Guinevere and her husband are ignored – that’s mostly a European thing so you can’t blame Japan for not knowing the full story). In the middle of the night you are just hanging out with the Princess and trying to figure out if she wants to be called “Prinny”, “Princess P”, 2P (not really but oh well). While you talk, you get this weird sensation of something coming closer and closer (the game actually uses a unique approach of the Mode 7 engine) to your castle. Suddenly.. CRASH! A Red Demon steals your girl for no apparent reason.
Get Your Princess in This Castle
So now, Arthur is pissed and leaves Cam…er… the castle, to seek revenge on the demon lord Sardius because he magically knows that’s who took her. Also, this same bastard has been stealing girls for a while so Arthur knows that she is being held captive in this castle at the end of the world. You get to hop through the window and go into the…erm… graveyard that Prin Prin keeps outside the castle. Maybe you have a red flag here?
Arthur will brave all the horrors of Sardius’s minions and the weird worlds they inhabit. All the while he must collect magical weapons, deal with landscape that changes all the time, and often gets forced to run around in his underwear… seriously, I’m not making this up. You travel through the graveyard, into the umm… ocean at the edge of the graveyard, down into the magma core of the earth, through a weird living tooth monster land, up a rainy monster tree, through a frozen wasteland, into two parts of a castle and finally to the throne room to face Sardius himself.
Unfortunately, there are some things you were not told, as it turns out, Sardius really only took 2P Chains (I don’t care, that’s what I am going to call her from now on) because he thought she had this thing called the “Goddess Bracelet” because… you know… evil Satan-like demons love to hold things owned by gods and goddesses, it won’t burn them up or anything #maybenottrue. Plus, this bracelet is so powerful that if Arthur touches it without the magical God…er…Gold armor, he can’t live either. However, because 2P Chains is a bit of a blue-haired airhead, she accidentally dropped this priceless artifact somewhere along the way. No… of course she doesn’t remember where, she just dropped it while the red demon was taking her to the castle.
I did not sign up for this!
So after you have trudged through 6 planes of death, often in just your underwear, you finally beat Sardius’ minion, Astaroth (and his jealous brother Nebirtoh – the dude is actually green) and you hope to save hottie 2P Chains and get some double P action, only to find out that you have to do it all over again because the actual bad guy can’t be beaten by anything but the VERY THING she dropped. You get sent back to the beginning. Only now that bad guys KNOW you are coming and so everything got massively harder and they called in all the reinforcements for each kind of monster. Plus, all the boss monsters have now taken steroids and have entire playbooks about how you beat them last time. That means that the monsters are harder, the maps are more complex, the bosses cannot be beaten the same way, and if you don’t somehow find this mythical “Goddess Bracelet” before you get back to the castle of Sardius, you will not be able to beat him. Dude! 2P Chains really blew it this time! Maybe you ought to talk to that hottie Guinevere over (*smacked with the ‘canon’ stick*) .. ahem… sorry, where was I? Oh yeah! You have to beat the “Fiend” Sardius using the Goddess Bracelet that 2P Chains dropped on the way after you have combed the entire map again to look for the long lost amulet.
Why do my pants have a face?
Ultimately, you get to face off against the Fiend Sardius who stands a full two stories above you. You can shoot him with the lightning bolt power of the “Goddess Bracelet” (though it is actually pretty unwieldy). But for some strange reason, his ‘crotch mouth’ (a staple of the final baddies in this series it seems), spits out ice-like platforms to allow you to jump up and blast his blue, white-bearded, face, repeatedly until he finally blows up. Hooray! You have defeated Sardius and saved Princess Prin Prin! You can now ride off in the sunset with your blue haired girl. However, the game couldn’t possibly let you go of their massive franchise so you are actually greeted with a “The End…?” screen because… well… Sata..erm… Sardius is an eternal bad guy and he likely will want to steal your princess again sometime because that’s what eternal bad guys do so don’t get too comfortable. Roll Credits!
Gameplay
Easily the most difficult thing about mastering this game is understanding the unique mechanics of the game’s controls. Arthur is able to execute double jumps, use variety of weapons, upgrade his armor and ultimately use a type of ‘charge up’ to complete the most powerful use of each weapon. Some of the weapons in the game are fantastic and work very well in a wide variety of situations while others are completely useless, even for basic combat. Oh yes, and don’t forget the various treasure chests in the game. You will find yourself battling all manner of horrors throughout the map stages. There are zombies, ghosts, wolves, flying demons, faeries (I’m not talking Tinkerbell here), monster fish, giant bears with clothing, and countless others. You must jump, scream, claw, and strive through over 7 different levels with all varying kinds of environments from a graveyard, to the ocean, to this horrifying tooth cave of death, etc. Each stage has a boss at the end that seems to fit the genre of the stage you are playing and these monsters range from the normal (giant birds of death) to the really weird (mushroom coral monster anyone?)
Basics
First of all, the character has some basic moves. Arthur can move left and right in the standard fashion of side-scrolling games. He can also climb ladders if you position him over them and press the “Up” button. If you press the jump button one time, Arthur will do a basic jump that generally gets him across normal gaps or up small platforms. However, if you press jump once and within a 2-3 seconds, press it again, he will double jump which will generally get him across everything else and can even be used to jump up to different levels instead of climbing the ladders (especially useful for speedrunners). You can also change the direction of the second jump by pushing right or left with the arrow key while also pressing the second jump button. Sometimes, the only way to get over a particular obstacle is to do a ‘zig zag jump’ wherein the player pushes a direction such as left while pressing jump for the first time, then pressing the opposite direction (right in this example) and jump again. In this situation, Arthur will jump at a 45 degree angle one way, then jump another 45 degree angle the opposite way.
Chests
I CURSE you!
The other prevalent thing you will find in this game are treasure chests. These are generally unseen until your character jumps at a certain area on the screen or does a particular motion in a certain map space. When you do this properly, a chest will appear and seem to ‘jump’ out of the ground nearby. The wise player will learn the ‘hot zones’ where these appear. Sometimes the chests will drop weapons (discussed next), sometimes they will drop armor (discussed a little later), and sometimes they will release a magician who will cast a spell on you. This spell is probably one of the most annoying things in the world because you have no control over what you are turned into. Arthur may become a goose, a bee, an old man, a little girl, a pig, or if the game is really being evil to you, a baby. Why is the baby so evil? Because he is very slow and if you get hit by any enemies, you will get stunned and be unable to move for a few moments. If that happens while you are in the mix with a bunch of baddies, you will almost certainly die. But without the treasure chests and the potential for any number of weird things that might happen with the magician’s curse, you can’t get any weapons or armor and without those, well… why are you playing? You will also encounter various jars that are either carried on enemies or sitting around on the map; usually these will just give you cash bags (worth various points based off the dollar amount) or glowing knight statues which will give you 200 points for free. On a rare occasion, a jar will give you a weapon, often whether you want it or not. So let’s look at weapons next, shall we?
Weapons
Why don’t I have a sword?
So you can jump around the map and double jump, but how does he attack? Well, that is pretty simple. You start the game with a lance (weird since this is Arthur… famous for using a SWORD… *canon stick waves menacingly above me* but that’s not important, heh…) that you throw, much like a javelin or spear. It is great for basic damage and flies in a straight line when shot. What makes this even funnier is that the box of the game and the cartridge shows him carrying a sword but there really is no such weapon in the game. You may also find a variety of other weapons including the crossbow which is VERY useful as it shoots a projectile in front of you and at a 45 degree angle above you which will take out most flying creatures after a few hits and there are plenty of those! You may also find the torch as a weapon of interest but it is best saved when facing slow enemies, large enemies, or those that can’t move much as it flies up, then falls down at an angle and creates a fire geyser. You also have a throwing ax which is very slow but does some decent damage if used on the right enemies – it will fly up at a 45 degree angle and then go straight down on whatever is below it.
Beyond these, most of the other weapons are useless. There is a pitiful throwing knife that, although it is fast, does very little damage and goes straight out like a lance (so why not use that since it’s more damage anyway). You will also find a scythe which is basically like a boomerang but does very little damage unless it happens to strike an enemy flying at you as it returns. Then there is a weird, rotating knife thing called the ‘tri-blade’ but it doesn’t try to hit anything… seriously, it lazily glides out from your character’s head, goes down then straight and continues this strange up and down meandering pattern. However, much like Castlevania games, you have no choice about changing weapons – if you touch the weapon when it comes out of a chest, you will lose the weapon you had and be forced to use whatever weapon you just got.
Sometimes, the appearance of the items on the map are so unfortunate (like, if you need the crossbow because you know that there are four flying demons in the next section of the map but you randomly get a useless tri-blade from the chest) that it’s actually better to kill your character (the game gives you an infinite number of continues so… eh?) than to pick up the weapon. Now the great king of the Britons is reduced to committing seppuku… what is the world coming to? Lastly, there is the Goddess Bracelet which you can ONLY get if you have the Gold Armor and we’re going to get to that part now.
Armor
I’m too sexy for my pants
Ah yes, one of the unique quirks of the game is the way your character takes “hits”. Many platform games both past and present will give the character a ‘life bar’ or ‘hit points’ or something like that to gauge how much damage you can take. However, this is not the way that Super Ghouls and Ghosts works. Nope… you basically have two hit points. If you have not been hit, you wear ‘steel armor’ which is gray and similar to what you’d expect from a knight. However, if you get hit while wearing the steel armor, Arthur decides to run around in his underwear… literally… yup, the hero of Arthurian legend running around in white boxers with red polka dots on them. If you get hit again while Arthur is in his undies, you die – geez… I hope they were clean.
This is not Bronze…
But don’t fear, you actually can get additional suits of armor to help you with your quest – as long as you aren’t always in your undies… don’t be a weirdo anyway. The first upgrade you get is called the “Bronze Armor” which is awfully strange because it’s… umm… blue green? If you are hit while wearing the Gree-Ronze armor, Arthur simply returns to his steel armor meaning that you can take 3 hits in this armor before you die. Not to mention, when you have the ahem… Jade… Armor, each weapon looks different and is more powerful. The lances make a neat laser noise, glow blue/green and do more damage. The crossbow becomes a laser pointed set of tri-arrows that blast in three directions. The axes look more like you are tossing flying guillotines and the scythe looks more like a throwing star to name a few changes. However, if you are hit once and return to the steel armor, your weapons are only the boring standard weapons again. If you want to keep the awesome power-ups and take more damage, then you need the Gold armor…
Fear Me!
If you somehow manage to not get hit by all the horrible monsters in this game while wearing the Jade armor, you will eventually open a treasure chest that gives you the Gold armor which is obviously the best of the breed and it makes Arthur look pretty bad ass. Seriously… he is like a gold ball of awesome with a neat feather. It also gives him access to a wide array of shields that may appear in the chests but most sources agree that the shields are pretty much useless unless you are really good with them. In addition to the awesome look of the armor, that means Arthur can take 4 full hits before he dies and that’s like… invincible in this game. He gets to keep the awesome power-ups of his weapons from the Bron-reen armor and even learns how to do magic! Well… one spell anyway. But it is also ONLY with the Gold Armor that you can hope to wield the Goddess Bracelet. In fact, without the Gold Armor, the Goddess Bracelet will NEVER appear in a chest. So until you get REALLY good at not getting hit by the hordes of monsters, you will never be able to beat the ultimate bad guy and win the game.
The secret to this game is basically to learn what weapons you are best at, learn how to use the double jump with high effectiveness, and well… not get killed. The fact that you cannot even beat the game unless you can keep the Gold Armor and find the Goddess Bracelets is proof positive that the developers of this game were sadists. They only want to watch you suffer! But if you get good at leaping, weapons swapping, and using the map to your advantage, you can eke your way through and beat this game… twice.
Review
Ah! Now we come to the part you’ve all been waiting for, my review! Yes, even though I have been gaming for over three decades and consider platform games one of my talents, it took your boy RGB here a VERY long time to beat this beast. I only played this game a few times when I was younger and would usually avoid it if I remembered what’s good for me. But now I managed to make it through this game by dedicating about 4 hours per night over the course of a week or so until I beat it. Now, I’m not going to lie, I made liberal use of the “Save State” feature on my emulator several times until I memorized the maps and the enemies. However, I actually made it all the way through the game with no save states until I arrived at Sardius’ throne room so I felt your pain all the way through. This game has some very nice graphics for the era, a really cool mix of weapons and plenty of goodies to keep you moving. However, it is frightfully difficult and occasionally darn near impossible. Without further ado, here are “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly” of Super Ghouls and Ghosts.
The Good
I feel so dirty!
First of all, this was released very early in the SNES library – within six months of the console’s launch – yet it seemed graphically stunning compared to the other games of the time. The developers used a unique mixture of nicely painted but static background layers, full motion front layers to illustrate rain and snow, and a mind numbing use of the Mode 7, pseudo 3D capability of the SNES. In fact, it the fourth stage, Arthur is traveling through a ‘living cavern’ with a floor that changes from a pulsating tan skin (ew!) to a writhing mass of gesticulating teeth (WTF?) all while Arthur must float around on membranous mucus platforms while avoiding steam vents and ax-wielding brutes. The game designers used Mode 7 to make this horrifying stage rotate around Arthur while he avoids geysers of death and ground with teeth. Likewise, when you are on the ocean/ghost ship stage, the developers used gentle shifts of the Mode 7 technology to make the boat ‘sway’ in the water and to make the waves rise and fall on Arthur as he pilots a raft on the water of death. While it’s true that Super Mario World (the launch title of the SNES) used many of these features as well, they were not as potent because of the more cartoon-like design of those characters. Super GnG was not afraid to scare the crap out of you with dark landscapes you might find in a vampire movie , truly scary looking monsters (well… the ghosts were pretty lame but I digress).
Next, Super GnG took the standard approach of a platform game such as side-scrolls, creative jumping, map distractions, etc. and took them to the next level by adding weapons, power ups, landscape that transforms as you interact with it (such as a rock suddenly shifting when you step on it or waves crashing over a map and wiping out almost all of the places to stand), and an endless array of monsters to beat. I would almost go as far as to say that the game established many of the standards found in later platform games. You really have to learn what weapons work best against a certain enemy, figure out how to not die while attacking that enemy, and use jumping in a way that really pushes you to the limit of your own ability. As someone who considers themselves skilled at platformers, not even the best muscle training in the world can prepare you for some of the crazy things this platform makes you do. It takes a short time to learn but a long time to master.
Lastly, the game keeps its creepy air with a clever mix of humor but never overdoes either piece. No matter what you do, you always feel like this game wants to kill you (and it does) and even the slightest wrong move can make you die horribly. That, mixed with the altogether terrifying look of the monsters (final bosses aside), keep you feeling creeped out and quite uncomfortable. But these ingredients are exactly what makes this game awesome! You feel the macabre sense of the world but still get a laugh at a dude running about in his underwear or bears in clothing. The game has an atmosphere to it that is both creepy and fulfilling at the same time. If only you can NOT DIE long enough to enjoy those things.
The Bad
Despite the fun and challenging aspects of the game, it is not without its flaws. As with many games that were pushing the limits of a new system, Super GnG has some aspects that did not quite flesh out when it was released. For instance, when you go through the world the second time through, the amount of monsters is literally doubled in almost every stage. Not only does this challenge the player, but it also challenges the hardware. When you face a map full of baddies, especially ghosts, each one has its own individual sprite layer that forms independently around the others and this stresses the game’s rendering engine to a high degree. So much so, that many sprites at once can cause screen to flash violently enough to trigger seizures and cause the player to die while the game is trying to answer all the sprite requests plus the inputs from your controller that its trying to process.
Next of all, the more you think about Super GnG and Super Mario Brothers, it’s easy to see how one could consider them copies of one another. After all, when you start out on Super Mario World, your character is “small Mario” who will die if he’s hit. However, if you happen to have a mushroom to make “big Mario” or a cape to make “Flying Mario” and you hit an enemy, you will lose that power up and go back to “small Mario”. Plus, the ultimate bad guy in the game steals the Princess for no apparent reason (especially Bowser, he just stole Peach to be a dick). Mix that with a creative use of Mode 7 graphics to change the rotation of things on the map and it starts to feel like Super GnG was a weird attempt by Capcom to steal Nintendo’s secret sauce for platform games. They didn’t win though, but it is notable.
Fear our crotch mouth!
Finally, the ultimate bad guys look pretty freaking dumb compared to some of the other monsters you have to face. For instance, Sardius’s minion, Astaroth and his more powerful form Nebiroth look pretty dumb. Not to mention, Sardius himself looks pretty underwhelming when you consider the alternatives. I mean, seriously… these guys look like Santa Claus got pissed off, grew a crotch mouth and tried to take over the world. From a game that has ax murdering monsters that appear out of thin air, zombies that look pretty terrible, and enemies that move all over the map, I expected SO MUCH MORE from the ultimate bad guys. They basically stomp around (they don’t even jump really), spit lasers at you, and shoot fire from their crotch mouths. It’s such a let down! You want to HATE the ultimate bad guy of this game, especially after you have to go through the game TWICE just to beat him. Yet… all you get are these weird dudes who you honestly feel sorry for more than you fear. I mean, the crotch mouth is pretty scary but only if it was like… a real head. I simply didn’t feel like it was worth it to go through all the trouble just to beat these idiots.
The Ugly
For everything this game had in awesome graphics, spooky sounds and worlds, and challenging platforms it is pretty great. I can accept the similarities between it and Super Mario, look past the idiotic styling of the demon overlords and the graphic glitches. But there are a few things out of this that I simply cannot accept and are part of the reasons that I will not be in any hurry to replay it.
First of all, doing this game twice is damned idiotic! I understand that in the arcade format of this game, it makes sense to double the game time so that the arcade (and Capcom) can squeeze more quarters out of you. But when it was ported to the SNES, that should have been less important. Now, it’d be a different story if…say… you had to go back through a world that had been radically changed after your first encounter with the bad guy (think World of Balance versus World of Ruin in Final Fantasy III/VII or the time-based changes when you changed the past of something in Chrono Trigger to impact the future) but Super GnG doesn’t do this. Nope! They just make you replay the whole game because Sardius is a jerk and he hates you!
Lame endings are for losers
Second of all… this story is freaking dumb! I mean, seriously, at least be a bit creative as to why you care about fighting the bad guy and saving 2P Chains. She just randomly gets kidnapped by Satan, you have to go through a maze of death just to learn she was an airhead and dropped something that Sardius wanted and you have to go save her. Yes, I get it, this is a hack and slash ghost game so I should not have my expectations so high but to make a story that is so devoid of any value, you’d at least hope that the ending would be good and it’s not. Nope… you are just stuck wondering if the Eternal Evil™ will return and you don’t even get to carry a real sword. You just basically ride off into the sunset with your blue haired bimbo of a girlfriend who probably almost got you killed because she’s a forgetful klutz. It’s very unfulfilling after all the hell you went through…twice… to get to the end. Of course, it’s at least slightly better than the end sequence of the NES version of Ghosts ‘N’ Goblins because it is at least in…well… English… that ending was so bad that it ranked on WhatCulture Gaming’s Most Insulting Game Endings.
Finally, the world repeatedly tries to kill you. That’s right, every. single. stage. tries to murder you mercilessly and the developers just laughed about it. Normally the first stage of a game ‘eases’ you into the crazy but not Super GnG…oh no… halfway through the stage the waves crash over the map and if you aren’t standing on a rock, you will die. Then, the second stage has indestructible guillotines plus hordes of ghosts and a raft ride of death that tries to kill you. Then, in the third stage you are surrounded by lava that tries to kill you and fire-breathing bears in sweaters that try to kill you. The fourth stage is the god awful stage of skin and teeth where even the world tries to kill you. The fifth stage is full of rain washes and disappearing platforms that try to kill you. The sixth stage has FUCKING avalanches that try to kill you… oh and ice-breathing bears in sweaters that try to kill you. I could go on and on but I won’t. I fully respect that there are some games that really make you work hard to get through them but they usually entice you with a good story or some areas of the game that let you breathe easy. Nope… not Super GnG… the world hates you, the developers hate you, your princess is a bimbo who got herself in trouble, and you have to march through hell twice.
Final Thoughts
So now I come to the end of a game that I really wanted to love, especially since it took me so long to actually get around to beating it. There is no doubt about it, this game will challenge even the most seasoned of platform runners. You will find yourself immersed in a macabre world that is almost likened to a horror genre game but with just enough quirky weirdness to make you smile and laugh a little. It is a stunning example of even the beginnings of what Mode 7 graphics could do (and eventually did) and how it could be used in varying degrees. The uniqueness of this game will make it stand out in anyone’s mind and you will have a fine time tuning your skills high enough to beat this monster.
However, this game left much to the imagination as it was somewhat too powerful for the hardware it was written on. It also had a really stupid requirement to complete twice. Now, I should note that i have actually played two other games from this franchise: Gargoyle’s Quest (think being the bad guy in a Super GnG world) and the beautiful Demon’s Crest which did the replay the world mechanic quite well and made you want to do it. I know that Capcom can make repeating a whole game interesting, they just did not do it with this game. You will also find that the game’s final bad guys are downright dumb so don’t expect too much and you might not be let down. If you can ignore the double play action, the somewhat stupid ending, and the levels with murder in their eyes, you will be able to find a lot of great things about this game to love.
It’s very easy to become accustomed to a certain way a game operates as many of those playing platform games in this era did. Capcom succeeded in taking that type of gamer and pushing them to their utter limits in order to live in their world. There is something of an artistic poetry to being able to master each weapon in this game and the right time to use them. It’s a great achievement when you learn how to navigate the levels, memorize the hot spots for treasure chests (especially knowing they will always appear), reach the fully Gold Armor clad Arthur, and beat a game that is so darn difficult that it lands on many of the “Hardest SNES Games” lists that are out there on the internet. Yet the amazing success you have in beating something that you know took the effort makes the other things in this platform game not as hard to accept.
Ultimately, this game was a defining point in the SNES game history, a turning point in the formula for platform games, and a humorously twisted approach to Arthurian legend. If you fancy yourself a master platform gamer, I urge you to give this a shot but don’t expect you’ll be able to just breeze right through it, even with cheat codes. I often will try Game Genie/PAR codes on games at various occasions just to see how the world will respond to them and I can assure you that even the best cheat codes don’t make this game much easier to play. To be true to yourself as a gamer, only use cheat codes after you have made it through cleanly. If you’ve been putting off Super GnG for a while, now is the time to give it a go!
Good luck… seriously… you’re going to need it!

Conquering my Ghosts and…er…Ghouls
Filed Under : Super Nintendo by RGB
Jun.14,2018
Hello fans!
I’m taking a break from my heavy playing of SWTOR because I am in the last stages of the original game which requires me to complete several flashpoints, aka long dungeon-like special stages where you face ‘end game’ content from the original series. A single flashpoint can take at least two hours and is chock full of really tough bad guys. As a result, you all benefit because I dusted off my old list of retro games. I started a playthrough of Mega Man X but decided I was not in the mood to replay it right now. I then looked through my list of ‘games I have not yet beaten’ and decided to pursue one that stands out as one of the toughest SNES games I know – Super Ghouls an Ghosts.
For anyone who is unfamiliar with this game, it is a somewhat cheesy but fun game that was originally found on the NES as “Ghosts and Goblins” but was one of the early games ported to SNES and given the title “Super…etc.” Most people remember it as the game where your hero starts in armor but then gets hit and commences to walking around in his red and white boxers until he’s killed or gets new armor. It also features many humorous sounds such as the slightly morbid version of the “womp whomp whomp” sound that it makes when you die, etc.
I have started playing it and I remember EXACTLY why I hadn’t finished it. It is FREAKING HARD. Not to mention, the quick speed at which one dies for seemingly no reason. However, with a lot of focus and a bit of cursing, I have managed to get to the 4th level (out of 6). I hope to finish it soon and have a review. If so, be on the look out!

Wow! A Year of Silence
Filed Under : General by RGB
Jun.1,2018
Hello RGB fans! Wow, I can’t believe that the last time I posted here was over a year ago. Shows you how good I am at being a blogger (read “not good at all”). I have been gaming just as much but have not had much worth posting about. Recently, however, things have happened that warrant a post. I’ve moved!
You see, I spent the greater part of my life living in the OKC metro area, 15 years to be precise. There were good times and bad times, and I really did learn a lot about life as I matured there. It’s where my wife and I got married, it’s where we almost got divorced, it’s where we became parents – 5 times, it’s where I received my best paying jobs and where I was unceremoniously released from a company that did a major reduction in force (many years ago), it was even the place that I held my father’s hand as he died. But, as the old adage says, “the only thing that is constant in life is change”.
After working for a managerial role for a large university for 3 years, I started to become disillusioned with the place I called home. I watched as the state continued to shrink the funds for education in an already tight budget and witnessed the school in the city where my wife and I had our own dream home be reduced to 4 day school week, once again deny my special needs son the paraprofessional he desperately needed. I saw that my employer was not having any bigger budgets soon so my project would continue to be grossly underfunded and my salary (and the salaries of my staff) continue to stay flat. I started to look for new positions but found that I was making about as much as someone in my career could make if they remained in Oklahoma as no other positions had even comparable salaries. I started to look beyond the borders of my beloved home state and found a few. I was almost given a position in the Western Georgia/Eastern Alabama area. I had been pushed very high up the chain for a position in Pittsburgh. I had been considered for a position in Chicago. I had been considered for a position in Arizona, and even Austin, TX. However, the company that pursued me most actively was one in the Kansas City, MO area. Only 5 hours away from Oklahoma City.
After a few weeks of intense interviews, I decided that the position was the best I could get for the distance I needed to travel. Not to mention, it paid a pretty penny higher than my current role without the stress of the managerial role. My wife and I discussed it, agreed, and everything changed.
We now live in an affluent suburb of KCMO. I have gigabit internet. I have 1/3 of a basement for an office/studio/man cave. My children are in one of the top school districts in the entire USA (and the top one in this area), and we have a whole new city to explore. I wish I could say it has all been easy going but it has not. However, the tide has turned and things are looking good (for now at least). As my family and I get unpacked, organized, and find our rhythm in this new place, I hope to get more retro stuff out.
Some plans:
I’m playing Castlevania Symphony of the Night: XBox version so I’ll write a review of it
I’ve watched several “Let’s Play” videos on YouTube and may write my own soon enough
I am teaching my children how to play the old school games via emulators and my oldest already seems to have quite a flair for getting good at retro games
I also, have stepped down from teaching, at least for a bit. So that means I hope to have more time for my main job and of course… more time for gaming.

Renewal of the Retro and oh…Zyuranger!
Filed Under : Cartoons,Super Nintendo by RGB
Mar.20,2017
Hello Retro Fans!
It’s a wonderful beginning to spring in my part of the world. If there’s one thing that Spring makes me want to do, it’s SPEND MORE TIME INSIDE! Just Kidding (maybe not) but it is hotter during the day and with the high temperature in Spring reaching near all time highs, I shudder to think what the summer might be like. In any case, after spending a few months bouncing around from trying to play SWTOR with my critically low-speed (3 mbps on a good day) internet while my wife streams her Netflix and after spending another few months playing some highly modified Skyrim, I decided to take a break from all of that and return to… you guessed it… RETRO GAMES!
So what did I decide upon? Well, I normally do a yearly play through of Final Fantasy 2 (FF4 Japan) but honestly I have not done that in a few years. I almost did that but ultimately, I realized that I had only done one full play through of Final Fantasy 3 (FF6 in Japan) in recent memory so I decided to do it again. Ah… to walk through the 16-bit fields of snow toward Narshe in my MagiTek armor… what fun! Plus, in reviewing my site, I have never actually made an RGB style review of this game so I will do so when I am done.
At this point, I am only about 4 hours in to the game, I am about to finish all the ‘scenario’ quests after your crew flees Figaro Castle. I already did Locke’s scenario and Sabin’s scenario so now I just need to do the Edgar, Terra and Bannon scenario. I also am trying to develop some more of the characters that I usually don’t do much with (such as Gau and Gogo) to add a new spin. Of course, if any of you have played this epic game, you know it is VERY large and one of the most complex games of its time. Even the brief time I have spent in this world has reminded me of the greatness of this game and the series as a whole. I also am surprised to realize that I actually don’t remember as much of the story as I thought. Of course, I remember the key components: Empire, Returners, Terra, Espers, etc., but some of the finer points are still blurry. That’s a good thing, like having semi-fresh eyes.
On another note, I did something else to feed my retro soul. If you were a kid who grew up in the 90’s like me, you probably watched Mighy Morphin’ Power Rangers. I don’t know if you made it into Zeo, Dino Squad, Space Force, etc., but you probably at least remember: “Mastadon! Pterodactyl! Saber-Toothed Tiger! Triceratops! Tyrannosaurus! and Dragon Power!” You probably are also aware that Haim Saban is at it again and is planning on releasing a ‘darker and more adult-themed’ version of the Power Rangers for the movie coming out in a few days. I want to see this movie, have wanted to ever since I heard it was coming out and only moreso as I have watched trailers and researched it. I first decided to remind myself of the awesomeness of the original series (cheesy dialogue aside) by watching it over. I am almost done with Season 1.
However, I also remembered that a majority of the footage from the Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers was initially drawn from “Kyuryu Sentai Zyuranger” (Kyuriyu SIN-tie JYU-rain-jer) which came out in Japan about a year prior to the show we saw. To my excitement, Shout Factory picked up the original series some years ago because of its impacts on pop culture. It was not available to watch on any standard streaming service I found, BUT my Amazon Prime account allowed me to pay $2.99 per month extra to access the “Shout Factory” Channel with… YOU GUESSED IT… Zyuranger! So I decided to watch it (subtitles and all).
Wow… the character that Rita Repulsa (the main bad guy in MMPR) is based off of, “Evil Witch Bandora” is FREAKING evil. WAY worse than Rita ever was. In that story, she’s the “most powerful force of darkness this world has ever known” and she makes you believe that. Not to mention, her assistants (that are loosely used in MMPR) are much more capable (though still annoying) than their MMPR counterparts. In almost every episode, Rit…err… Bandora, always has some children (like young kids.. like 10 and even younger) in danger. Not just kidnapping them… no… more like shrinking them into a miniature space shuttle that is locked in place with a time-triggered IRON MACE BALL ready to drop and crush them if the Pow…I mean… Zyurangers don’t save them in time. Oh and that other kid who SHE TURNS TO STONE BECAUSE SHE IS EVIL is also a good example. I can imagine being a Japanese child in that era and literally being scared to death of Bandora.
Also, the rangers themselves are much less one-dimensional than their American counterparts (though only slightly). They represent 5 different tribes of prehistoric dino-worshiping people each with their respective creature of power… you guessed it: a Mammoth, a Pterodactyl, a Saber-Tooth Tiger, a Triceratops and a Tyrannosaurus (I have not yet gotten to the Green Ranger story). Each ranger was frozen for “170 million years” so they could defend the Earth when Bandora rose again. They appear to have no stupid high school drama to deal with (dude… they missed like… a ton of reunions) but also seem very much content to just sort of hang out with “Mysterious Sage Barza” (their version of Zordon but without the stupid “Ay yi yi yi” of Alpha 5) in his magical palace until they need to go fight Bandora’s baddies. I have only seen them do a few ‘non-fighting’ scenes so far but they appear to have at least some inkling of depth.
In any case, I am actually excited to learn how their story diverges from the story I know. I did figure out why Trini always looked ‘flat’ in her ranger suit. That’s because the Yellow Ranger in Zyuranger is actually a boy. He’s so much of a boy that his name is ACTUALLY ‘Boi’. Although the pink ranger is still a girl but her name is Mei and her favorite thing to do appears to be helping other people and saying “okay!” in perfect English when her ranger colleagues tell her to do something in Japanese. Barza is…well… strange. The verdict is still out on him.
See you guys later! I have watching and gaming to do!

Need a Distraction from Election Day? How about this – Sega Genesis Returns!
Filed Under : Sega Genesis by RGB
Nov.8,2016
Retro gamer fans, I hope you are all doing well on this fine election day in the US of A. I absolutely refuse to put any political stuff on my blog. However, you can always elect King Koopa or Medusa for president – you decide! However, if you are wanting a nice distraction from the election… how about this…
According to a story posted by GameZone and many other outlets, the Sega Genesis is back! Well… it will be back in June 2017.
The weird thing is that it’s not shipping from Japan… it’s shipping from Brazil! And before you go ape about it being a knock off product, it actually was blessed by Sega themselves! That means that the official console will actually serve as a release of a console that’s old enough to drink in the US! But why?
That’s an honest question! Turns out that TecToy, a Brazilian gadget shop makes lots of neat techie things and people are always asking about Sega. Why? It’s one of the most popular consoles in Brazil even 20+ years after release. How’s that for staying power? So, they concocted a way to make a new Genesis console and Sega blessed it. That’s pretty cool!
The new system should be using identical hardware to the original system with the only exception being that it will come with an SD slot to side load games. It comes with about 22 games out of the box. I am not yet sure if it will allow you to play ROMs by side loading them (provided you can still find a Sega ROM), but it might. Perhaps Sega will somehow relaunch their old titles with some agreement with TecToy but I have no details yet. It will allow you to play your old game cartridges if you still have them (sounds like we need to hunt a Vintage Stock or eBay list down).
The only caveat is that the new system comes with a $138 USD price tag. However, if you REALLY loved your Genesis and it broke somewhere down the line, you can probably start playing your Sonic and Tails with this spiffy console. Thanks TecToy for rekindling a much loved (though oft misunderstood) system.
RGB out!

Marking off another success in gaming
Filed Under : General by RGB
May.31,2016
Hello fans, I know it’s been a long time since I have posted any material. Unfortunately it will continue to be that way for some time. I am working two full time jobs to help pay down debt, raising 5 kids, and only have a tiny speck of time to do much gaming these days. However, I am STILL gaming some, just not anything truly Retro.
What little video game time I have for the last several months, has been spent playing Star Wars: The Old Republic. I know, it’s an MMO and updated recently so it’s not technically retro either. Hence why I have not had much to say on it. I will say that one of the things I really admire about this game is that each individual class on each side (Republic and Sith) have VERY distinct story lines and the choices you make during those story lines can greatly impact what happens. The game is also fully voice acted… that means that EVERY interaction from the most insignificant person all the way up to endgame content is 100% voice acted and you only have to read the text if they are speaking in another language (which does happen). So far, I have a number of characters that I have created. My first is a Bounty Hunter (Sith) who I played as a truly neutral PC, he has just the same amount of dark side points and light side points (or very close). My second was a Republic Trooper (Republic) who is literally a goody two shoes and I have NEVER picked the dark side choice EVER. Then I have my Sith Warrior who’s…well… all dark side and it shows.
In case you don’t know, you reach a certain point (always in the ‘intro world’) where you have a choice to make in a conversation that can either grant you Dark Points or Light Points. Maybe the choice is to take an NPC hostage or to kill them; in that case, if you take them hostage you get light side points (LS) and if you chose to kill them, you get dark side points (DS). The more you pick one side or the other, the more your character leans towards a LS or DS alignment and, the more…well… unique some answers get. One of my main characters is a DS Sith Marauder (Advanced class of the Sith Warrior) meaning they are a warrior-type character with dual lightsabers. I decided to literally make this character evil as can be and I RARELY pick the LS option if ever. Early, one when asked to take a quest to annihilate a camp of enemies, I picked the “I will kill them all” option and my character says “There won’t be a heart left beating.” But after a number of times of picking this, she became..well.. to use the Doctor Who term… bananas. When I picked a similar answer later, she actually said “I can’t wait to gut them and dance in their entrails.” Yeah… she’s pretty cold-hearted. LOL.
My First In-Game Trophy
Anyway, I finally got my original character, Kayserento Karanthos, the bounty hunter (Officially Mercenary as an advanced class) to level 65 and through all of the original game content (there have been about 4 expansions since the game was released). He ended up being excessively wealth (over 2.5MIL credits since he always got lots of money and rarely spent it). He also was a true neutral but has leaned more toward LS than DS because of the influence of his…er… wife. That’s right, you can actually marry your companions in the game and the first companion your character ever gets is a cybernetically enhanced slicer named Mako. She is the ONLY girl companion your character gets in this class. I decided it would be interesting to try and win her over. Unfortunately, she is kind of tricky because she prefers you to do ‘Good’ and earn money (basically the conscience of an otherwise brutal career path). So that means that any time I picked a DS choice and she was with me, she would “disapprove” meaning I lose some influence with her and every time I picked an LS choice, she would “approve” and increase my influence. It wasn’t until I got to about level 35 that the game mechanics allowed me to pick the ‘Flirt’ option with her and the first time I did it, I failed miserably. However, I got to about level 60 and suddenly I had all these Flirt options. In the end, he asked her to marry him and she accepted. All of this RIGHT AFTER I completed the final story sequence of the original Bounty Hunter path.All of this is to say that I have officially completed an entire story for the game (the game does actually keep track of the stories you complete and gives you bonuses as you go) as a Bounty Hunter. Think of this like a trophy option on Playstation or something of that sort.
The Corrupted Bothrium Beast (aka $%*#*$*! die already!)
I did go ahead and complete the first expansion planet missions and ended up fighting A TOUGH boss. Now, MMO’s have been known to make the game easier as it has grown in population and it’s not much different in SWTOR. I NEVER went into a quest on the game fearing for my life… ever. Yes, I died a few times because of my haughtiness, but it was rare. However, the final boss of the first Advanced planet (the evil moon of Oricon) is a monster called the “Corrupted Bothrium Beast” and he basically is like a giant squid that has been shooting random tentacles up through the ground in Oricon (yes, you fight disembodied tentacles in this planet). The beast’s owners (creators?), the Dread Lords of the Sith, say he is unbeatable but I had heard this before (as an MMO hypes you up against certain bosses) and turned them into Swiss cheese (get it…bullets? swiss cheese?). But when I started fighting this beast (with my wife by my side), I noticed that no matter how much damage I was dealing him (think DPS on steroids), he kept healing! I could literally wipe out half of his life in a single barrage of attacks but then I would blink and it would be back at full. I must have fought this dude for 20 minutes and was about to throw my mouse in the floor (hey, it’s on my laptop and I don’t want to just chuck it in the floor) when I finally hopped on my phone and looked up the technique to beating him. This is the first boss I have faced that I actually had to follow a specific pattern to beat him. Turns out that he fires off an ability called “absorb” early in the fight and usually targets your companion (my wife in this case) so they keep getting their energy sucked out and given to him but since my companions are always set to ‘heal’ they never let themselves (or me) die. I had to use my mercenary’s ‘interrupt’ skill (one that I rarely had to use) to kill the Absorb. Then, I had to waylay the boss with damage and kill any tentacles it sprouts (which also heals it but at a faster rate). Yay! It actually worked! But it wasn’t easy. That dude can fire off his Absorb quicker than I can fire off my interrupt attack (5s cooldown on his versus 10s on mine) but I usually managed to get him before he got back to full health. After 45 minutes I finally beat him! The prize? Reputation with the planet’s denizens, a little bit of credits, and the Achievement of “The Beast Below” (twitch, twitch) and that’s when I killed them your honor! (J/K but MAN was that frustrating).
So now you have a taste of what I have been doing for the past several months. I plan on getting through a number of storylines in this game because they are all very good (or at least the ones I have done so far). I started a Smuggler (Republic) yesterday and already got him up to level 10 so he can become the advanced class of Gunslinger and keeping him mostly LS. I still have to get my Sith Marauder, level 41, through the rest of that content, but when I stopped playing her last is when my next quest took me to the planet of Quesh. Why? Because I hate this planet! It’s almost as bad as Nar Shadaa (usually the third planet your Sith visits after they go to the capital of Drumond Kaas and the third one your Republic visits after going to Coruscant respectively) which is ENDLESS and very difficult to get around in. I made it through Nar Shadaa with my Bounty Hunter (leveled him from about 20 to 35 before he left) and yet I kept having random story arcs that would call me back to that place repeatedly. Quesh is usually a place you only have to go to once but I hated the time I spent there because it’s all thick with toxic waste plants, has really powerful enemies just wandering around every. single. road. and the storyline there (at least for my Bounty Hunter) was boring. I will pick back up playing Quesh with my Sith Marauder soon but mostly because her companion Jasea Willsam is also bananas (she’s a LS Jedi companion that you can convince to join the DS and when she does, she loses her freaking mind and becomes a crazy murderous bitch) so watching the two interact with each other is highly entertaining as I will illustrate below:
Quest Giver: “If we cannot stop the Republic from powering the shield generators, the Empire will not be able to maintain control of this planet.
My DS Sith who is pretty evil: “I think we should kill them all.”
Jaesa: “Yes, Master, let’s make their blood rain from the skies”
DS Sith: “Perhaps we can just destroy the plant’s energy cores”
Jaesa: “Why? Then we can’t hear the enemies scream as we kill them mercilessly.”
DS Sith: “Would you enjoy that, Jaesa?”
Jaesa: “Only if I can drink some of their blood, my lord.”
Me (the guy controlling the game): “Holy crap! You need some help Jaesa.”
Yes… this is not EXACTLY what she says in the game but it’s pretty darn close. She is quite the opposite of my Sith Warrior’s other female companion, Vette who tends to be very similar to Mako and always wants her to do the ‘LS’ thing.
If you found this interesting, let me know in the comments and I might do a few more stories about this game. It’s still pretty shiny and new to me (only been playing it for about 6 months) but that interest may also fade in time. We’ll see.

Super Mario Bros 3 Animation just discovered
Filed Under : Nintendo by RGB
Apr.12,2016
Hey fans! I am not sure if any of you guys are watching the same stuff I am but something totally awesome came up in the retro world! Evidently, a number of sources have mentioned that someone discovered an animation in Super Mario Brothers 3 that has never been seen before (or at least no one mentioned it). It’s just a testament to the fact that this game was highly revolutionary for its time that almost 30 years after it was released, people still find new things!
Anyway, if you played through the entire game of SMB3, you likely saw the rather interesting ‘suits’ that were made for this game that had not been seen before. Of course, the ‘Raccoon Tail’ Mario is something that has been seen the world over and was sort of copied in SMW on the SNES in the “cape”. This new power up allowed Mario to run then ‘fly’ above the world map for a certain period of time. Also, we met the “Frog Suit” Mario which turned Mario into a green frog and greatly facilitated getting through watery levels. You might have even seen the really weird “Tanooki Mario” which was kind of like a bear/raccoon suit that allowed you to well… turn into a statue for some reason. Last but not least, there was the “Hammer Suit” which turned Mario into an armored hero that could loft hammers at the Koopa Troopas – easily one of the most unusual forms of role reversal in the era. In this suit, if you pressed the “Down” arrow, Mario would go into a shell that could not be hurt but could also not be moved. If you were used to sliding down the angled slopes in the game and put this on, you would roll down the hilltop like a bowling ball but you could not slide.
Well, the gamer site “Kotaku” released a new tidbit. See, Nintendo thought of everything with this game. The developers of SMB3, at one time, asked themselves – what do we do if they are already sliding when they get this suit? Do they instantly turn into a shell? That could damage some players’ style of play. The answer was… nope… we’ll make a really weird animation that shows him sliding. Yup! Someone finally found this tidbit and posted it. So if you are playing SMB3, you can see Hammer Mario do a slide. Enjoy!
That’s it for now, RGB Out!

Finally Working on a New Game to Review
Filed Under : Sega Genesis by RGB
Sep.29,2015
Hey everybody! I am enjoying the fact that I have one more month of free time (more or less) until I start teaching classes again. As a result, I am trying to play through an RPG that I have never played before. It took some tweaking, but I was finally able to get a Sega Genesis emulator to start working (WAY more complicated than an NES/SNES Emulator). I tried playing an old favorite of mine, Toe Jam and Earl, but I simply could not motivate myself. I took a bit of time to play through and beat Bastion (a newer RPG/Platform game on the PC) before delving back into the emulator world. Finally, I ended up selecting Phantasy Star II (Probably stylized form of “Fantasy” to avoid trying to cash in on the success of ANYTHING with Fantasy in it and avoid a lawsuit with Nintendo). It’s cool because it takes the old-school RPG into a space age world. I know that the series was hugely successful and even now there is an MMORPG series of the same name but it’s only available in Japan and some European markets.
So far the game has been fun to play, it’s definitely a unique system and I am still getting used to the way Sega did things with the Sega, Master System, CD System, 32X, etc and finding the right pieces to make it work but I am coming along. It’s a very different RPG, that’s for sure. Nothing like fighting battles with monsters on this weird, blue grid that looks like the cover of the Neuromancer book and having a character who cannot fight in my party – seriously – the girl character Nei is not capable of fighting – her whole purpose is to heal which is cool but weird. Anyway, I am still very early in the play through, only halfway through the first dungeon, but I hope that I can get more accustomed to the game’s controls and rhythm enough to finish it and write a review before my classes start.
Stay tuned!

Something Retro – Though Not Gamer
Filed Under : Just Retro by RGB
Sep.22,2015
Hello everybody! I am actually at a pause before my next teaching session so I have a little free time. I hope to use it to play and review an old Sega Genesis game like Phantasy Star but I am not sure which one yet. Keep your eyes open for the review. In the meantime, I wanted to share something fun with you all that I picked up while browsing the interwebs.
I love watching the Fine Brothers’ videos because they always have some fun takes on popular culture. As far as I can recall, this is one of the first times I have seen them focus on a retro topic – especially one as near and dear to me as JNCOs. I have not been shy about admitting that I am a child from Generation X. I grew up playing Nintendo, watching SNICK (before the dumb “Club Nick Days”), loved MTV (back when it ACTUALLY SHOWED VIDEOS), had my fair share of Doc Martens (still do), flannels (my original is laying around somewhere), and of course… wearing JNCO jeans. Considering that JNCOs were so near and dear to my heart, I was not as pained as I thought I would be when I saw the teens reaction.
Let’s be honest, we didn’t NEED our jeans to be that big, that was not the point. When we wore these jeans, we felt like we had ample protection from whatever crazy issues we had to deal with as teens in the 90’s. I wore these jeans in almost all weather conditions and never felt like they were too hot or too cold. The pockets helped me keep my giant wallet with a chain on it (yes, I DID have one of those), it was lovingly referred to by my friends and family as “The Samsonite Wallet” and not only stored what little money I had but also served as a perfect weapon for whipping across a bully’s knees when the situation demanded it. I could store my cigarettes (thankfully I am an EX smoker now) and lighter in here and my teachers would never even know I had them on me – sure made it easy to grab a quick smoke between classes if I knew the path would be obscured from teachers or principals. I didn’t actually have a cellphone when I wore JNCOs, almost nobody did, but I could sure keep a TI-83 Calculator in there, a GameBoy (or other portable gaming device), and even my cordless phone when I was at the house. On at least 10 occasions, I placed an entire can of soda in those pockets. I have also placed Pop-Tarts, candy bars, napkins and (on a rare occasion) an entire jelly doughnut. Ah! Those were the days!
The JNCO jeans had a few acceptable support items that you could wear with them. They included Doc Marten lace-ups (generally black or brown), AirWalks, Vans, and (for some) tennis shoes like Adidas and Nike. Shirts were usually simple T-shirts with some sort of logo or graphic on them. I tended to wear band shirts (like 311, Insane Clown Posse, Kid Rock and others) or graphic tees such as my favorite shirt that was white with black collar and sleeve cuffs that simply said “Freak” on it. Oh, and let’s not forget the necklaces. Every dude had to have at least two necklaces at any given time. My favorite was my chain necklace that I fashioned out of a dog collar with large chain links connected in the back with three key rings and my dragon necklace which featured a cool chain and a sideways profile of a dragon. Occasionally I opted for an actual leather studded dog collar that was almost a choker but made me look freaking mean!
Okay, I have enjoyed my stroll down fashion memory lane! I hope you did as well. Beware that JNCOs are being brought back to the mainstream. Oh how I have waited for this day! I am first in line for the Stovepipes!

Totally Awesome Remix of the Final Fantasy II Prelude Theme
Filed Under : Just Retro,Nintendo by RGB
Mar.3,2015
Hey Retro Fans!
I try my best to not use my blog for advertising my other projects but this information is awesome for any retro gamers. I have not been quiet about the fact that Final Fantasy II is my favorite game/RPG of all time. One of the most memorable songs on the soundtrack is the one that plays at the title screen and in the “Crystal Rooms”. It’s a harp that plays rising and falling notes in a very pretty key. This song was named by its creator, Nobuo Uematsu, as “Prelude”.
At my DJ desk, I had been helping my daughter get the ropes of writing music by giving her sheet music and letting her play around in the studio. While she was working on Hot Cross Buns, I remembered that I had wanted to remix the FF Prelude song many years ago and I dug out my copy of the score. After a few days of working, I managed to create my own remix of this classic song. Here is the link. Tell me what you think!
Hope you enjoy it!

Hélène Grégoire
Hélène started skiing, like many others, at the family cottage near the nation’s capital in her hometown, Gatineau, Québec. Hélène believes her parents are responsible for her athletic accomplishments. Her father, Antoine Grégoire, ran the first water ski competition in the area at Blue Sea Lake.
She was a member of the national water ski team from 1970 to 1977, winning 10 national titles along the way. She also held Canadian records in girls jump, tricks and slalom, as well as those same records several years later in the wom-en’s category.
Jumping proved to be one of Hélène’s strong-est events. She won a bronze medal at the 1972 Pan American Championships. She fol-lowed that up the following year, placing fourth at her first World Championship, in Bogota, Columbia, narrowly missing the podium by 6 inches. She also placed 9thoverall at the 73 Worlds. Showing proficiency to ski her best in pressure situations, her two Canadian Open Women jumping records were set at the 1973 and 1975 World Championships.
Returning to the highest international stage, Hélène solidified herself as one of the top female water skiers in the world. At the 1975 World Champion-ships, she achieved a 5th place finish in jump, and a 6th in overall. Two years later, at the 1977 World Cham-pionships, she made a mark in slalom, earning a 7th place standing, as well as 10th in jump and 13th overall.
Hélène was inducted into the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame in 1987. After retiring from water skiing, Hélène pursued her career in dentistry in which she has practiced since 1979. She is currently working in a dental office in Gatineau, QC, and is the proud mother of two daughters.

Andy Murdison
Andy Murdison was born April 12, 1946 in Toronto, Ontario. He started water skiing five years at the family cottage in Haliburton, Ontario. After its debut at a young age, he took several titles.
Andy's first foray on the national scene took place in the nationals in 1962 at Lac St-Jean, Quebec. He won the overall title in his first boys national championships. After that, he established the Lake Boshkung Skiers with friends. He became one of the best clubs in the country at that time, with its members winning many titles. The club also hosted the Ontario championships and nationals.
In 1965, Andy won a spot on the Canadian team to participate in the skiing world championships in Surfers Paradise, Australia. It was his first year at the University, so with little time to train, he did not as well as he hoped, but he turned that disappointment into motivation. 1966 is when it all began to fall into place for Andy. He participated in the Pan American Championships in Mexico, finishing fifth in the slalom. He and teammate Jean Perrault have spent time training in Mexico that winter Tito Antunano, who later became world champion in slalom. With the world championships scheduled for 1967 take place at home, in Sherbrooke, Quebec, he also led throughout the summer with the national team in Hudson, Quebec, and the site of the world championships. The strategy worked as Andy has improved.
He ranked ninth in the combined 10th in trick and eighth in slalom and helped Canada rise much higher in the team standings. He continued his international breakthrough in the ranks. 1968 Pan American Championships in Colombia, he took fourth place in slalom. Andy holds a Canadian record slalom has never been surpassed. It was established in skiing at 38 m / h. The highest speed slalom ski was reduced to 36 m / h in 1966 and the course has been shortened. Andy won four national titles in boys and four national titles in men. It was one of the best international skiers from 1965 to 1969.
Andy married his high school sweetheart, Bev. They have two children, Andrew and Tom. who have become excellent wakeboarders and kite surfers.

His tireless promotion of the sport helped launch Freestyle Skiing into the Olympics in 1988.
Following his sporting career Greg became a sought after coach and professional photographer. He also helped raise more than $150,000 for the B.C. Children’s
Hospital with his annual charity ski camp at Whistler. In the words of Olympic Champion Nancy Greene, “ Greg was like a pebble in the pond, those close to the first ripple were indeed fortunate, yet as the ripples expanded, he continued to touch and influence a vast network of friends, colleagues and competitors.”
With this induction Greg now becomes a member of both the Water Ski and Wakeboard Canada and Canadian Ski Halls of Fame.
Lisa Long (Sokolowski)
Lisa Long, formerly Lisa Sokolowski was one of Canada’s prominent water ski athletes in the late 1970’s to early 1980’s. She was a member of the Canadian National Water Ski Team from 1978 to 1982, where she compiled numerous records and performances for Canada.
Long came first overall at the Canadian Water Ski Championships numerous times beginning in 1975, again in 1978 and finally in 1982. Her most notable Canadian result came at the 1977 Canada Games where she finished 1st in the Slalom and 3rd in Tricks on her way to the Overall Title. In addition to her success within Canada, Lisa was chosen to represent Canada at the Pan American Water Ski Championships three times; in 1978, 1980 and 1982. Her best Pan Am performance came in 1980 where she finished fourth overall, with a fifth place finish in slalom and fourth place in both tricks and jump.
Lisa will always be remembered as a team leader, an incredible athlete and a great competitor.
Jeff Heer
Jeff Heer is one of the most important Canadian wakeboarders in history. Not only was he a pioneer as a rider but he has also made a huge impact on the Canadian wakeboard scene as a coach and mentor to younger Canadian wakeboarders like Chad Sharpe, Kevin Henshaw, Aaron Rathy, and Rusty Malinoski.
Getting his start in water skiing, Jeff was setting records in B.C. at the age of 13. He became a member of the Canadian Junior National Water Ski team, competing at the Junior Worlds in 1992, and dreamt one day of becoming a member of the Canadian Senior National Water Ski team. Instead, he followed in the footsteps of fellow Canadian water skier, Jeremy Kovak in crossing over to the up and coming sport of wakeboarding. 1994 marked Jeff’s first full year on the pro wakeboard tour where he finished 4th at the U.S. Masters, 2nd at one of the pro tour stops, and 1st at the World Wakeboard Championships. He also had many top 10 finishes at other events during the same year.
Throughout his wakeboard career Jeff put up consistent performances and was a familiar face at all the pro tour stops, the U.S. and Canadian Masters, Wakestock where he was the first ever champion, as well as the Canadian Nationals where he became the first ever Canadian Champion.
‘’I’m super stoked about the induction,’’ said Heer, who currently works in national water ski and wakeboard distribution in Vancouver. ‘’It was a real thrill to be part
of the sport in its infancy and to help it evolve to the point to where it is becoming more and more mainstream around the world.’’
Although Jeff made quite an impact as a rider and a competitor he is most revered for his efforts behind the scenes as coach, mentor and sponsor to up and coming Canadian wakeboarders. Stories of Jeff focusing on the development of future wakeboarding stars over all else run rampant throughout the wakeboard community and attest
to his lifelong commitment to the sport.

Hoggan was a dominant player in national women’s water skiing for a full decade as proven by her six straight overall national championship titles between 1964 and 1969.
Her illustrious water skiing career included many Canadian titles. In 1968, Vailla finished first in women’s tricks at the Canadian Nationals, earning herself a Canadian record. Also in 1968, Hoggan became the first Canadian woman to win gold in slalom at the Pan American Championships in Bogota, Columbia.

Jim Clunie
Jim Clunie’s history in the sport of water ski has been extensive. As a jump specialist, Clunie was a member of the National Team and competed at many prestigious international tournaments, including several World Championships and Pan American Games and Championships. He helped team Canada to four team world championship medals including gold in 1991 and 1993. He also won an individual bronze in jump at the 1993 and 1997 worlds and posted fourth place finishes at both the 1995 and 1999 Pan Am Games.
Clunie has made a recognizable name for himself in the water ski community. Away from his status as a competitive athlete, he has involved himself in other areas within the sport such as being a member of tournament and training camp organizing committees and currently as chair of Water Ski and Wakeboard Canada’s National Team Development Committee.
Beyond his titles as an athlete and committee member, Clunie bestowed a level of respect, determination and integrity on the sport. His coaches, teammates and international athletes have all referred to him as “the little man with a big heart” – a man who believes that values, fair play, family and nationalism are of the utmost importance. He never overlooked the volunteers who worked behind the scenes, always extending them his acknowledgement and gratitude.
“Jim is the most enthusiastic team player we have had in my 27 years on the team,” said National Team head coach Steve Bush. “And on top of that, he proved time and time again that he was one of the top jumpers in the world.”
‘’I’m a bit surprised to receive this great honour,’’ said Clunie, who currently runs two businesses in his hometown. ‘’The highlight for me was the world team title in 1991: no one had ever beaten the U.S., before. The whole experience with the national team was fun and unique. We all grew up together and we had a lot of pride. I try to stay involved as much as I can, the sport for me, is a passion.’’
Clunie remains one of the most respected skiers in Canada. His passion for life and for the sport makes him an exemplary person and athlete who always leads by example.
Karyn Scarpa-Cromwell
Scarpa-Cromwell established herself as a trailblazer in barefoot water skiing. She was a member of the National Barefoot Team for many years and is a seven time National Open Champion. She still holds all three Canadian records in the Women 1 divison, and 2 in the Open Women division. On the international scene she placed 6th in all 4 events at the 1988 World Barefoot Championships and won three medals at the 1992 world championships including silver in the overall and helping Canada to a best-ever third in the team event.
To this day, she is the only Canadian barefoot worlds overall medalist. Scarpa-Cromwell also took home a Gold Medal in jump at the 2003 Sr. World Championships.
Karyn has served on the WSWC Barefoot Committee, was a member of the Pan Am Barefoot Council and the World Barefoot Council.
“It’s great to be recognized for all the hard work I put into the sport,” said Scarpa-Cromwell, who now resides in Lakeland, Florida. “It was a great experience and I’ve encouraged my kids to get involved in sports at a high level and get that satisfaction of working hard for a goal and reaching it.”

Kreg Llewellyn
Kreg Llewellyn got an early start to his water ski career when he frequented Sylvan Lake with his family. At age 6 he entered a tournament and the rest is history. Kreg is one of Canada’s most successful skier’s of all time. Known for his strength in Jump and for his mastery in Tricks, he was a dominant force on the water ski circuit for over 20 years. Kreg’s first year on the National Team was 1984 and his brilliant skiing played an important role in the team’s World Championship titles in 1991, 1993 and 1999.
Despite being plagued with several injuries over the years, Kreg still managed to win three medals at the 1991 World Championships in Austria, equaling the best-ever performance of 3 medals at a worlds for any Canadian. He is a 2 Time World Overall Silver Medalist, a World Slalom Medalist, U.S. Masters Trick Champion, 2 Time U.S. Open Overall and Trick Champion, and a Moomba Masters Overall and Trick Champion. Kreg currently holds 24 Canadian National Records in all three water ski events.
“It’s something you don’t think about in your competitive years but it is sure nice to get that recognition,” said Llewellyn, whose younger brother Jaret is currently one of the biggest stars in the sport. “It’s a great opportunity to thank everyone that helped you along the way. Water skiing can be an individualistic sport so for me my fondest memories are winning the world team titles for Canada.”

George Athans
George Athans learned some valuable lessons from his numerous triumphs in international water skiing, skills he would use to develop a successful career in television.
''Winning those world titles taught me a lot about hard work, time management, setting and reaching personal goals and also a sense of fair play,'' said Athans. ''Those are things I use daily in my career today. ''Athans became famous in Canada in the early 1970's earning the overall titles at the 1971 and 1973 world water skiing championships, the first Canadian world champion in the sport since Charles Blackwell in 1953 and only the third ever, at the time, to win consecutive world crowns.
He was bestowed with awards and honours soon afterwards including induction into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame in 1971, Canada Sports Hall of Fame in 1974 and received the Order of Canada, also in 1974.
He was on the national team from 1966 to 1974. He broke 28 Canadian records in his career and won 10 consecutive national titles. Athans says that being among the first inductees into Water Ski & Wakeboard Canada's Hall of Fame is a thrill.
''I'm honored to be recognized among such a select group of outstanding Canadian skiers,'' he said. ''I'm amazed at how well Canada has done in world competition. Few sports have achieved so much success. If I have inspired any of those skiers that followed me then I'm very proud.''
Since his retirement, Athans has managed a successful television career. He kept a high public profile as a sports reporter for CBC Television in Montreal for many years. He still works in the TV business today as an award-winning producer and director.

Charles Blackwell
The late Charles Blackwell was Canada's first water skiing world champion. And he did it in style earning the men's slalom gold on home waters in Toronto in 1953. The Ontario capital was the first Canadian city to host the water skiing worlds.
Blackwell started water skiing rather late at age 17 in 1948 but within two years he was winning tournaments on a consistent basis including the world crown and three Canadian titles. At Expo '67 in Montreal, he was awarded a special gold medal for his world triumph.
He worked 33 years for Kodak of Canada then purchased and operated Pointe au Baril Marina near his cottage at Harris Lake, Ont.
His wife Mary Lou pre-deceased him in 1991 and Charles Blackwell passed away in 1994. They had four daughters including twins.
''Dad was always proud of everything he did,'' said his youngest daughter Sandra Blackwell. ''Water skiing gave him some wonderful adventures, though he was never into boasting about his accomplishments. He taught us all to ski but never pushed, just taught."
Charles Seward Blackwell Jr. will forever be known as Canada's first water ski world champion.
Charlie Blackwell was a Canadian pioneer in the sport. He became the first athlete from this country to win a gold medal (slalom) against athletes from many other countries at the World Championships held in Toronto. This event was the first of three World Championships to be held in Canada and his success was the inspiration for other Canadian World Champions to follow - George Athans, Pat Messner, Joel McClintock, Judy McClintock, Jaret Llewellyn, and the Canadian Team - 1st ever to defeat from 1991 to 1995 the powerful water skiers from the U.S., who had forever reigned as the best water skiers in the world. But Charlie Blackwell was the "first" and his 1953 success pointed the way to the future.
Charlie Blackwell also played a quiet background role in the development of Canada's top position in world water skiing. He served on the executive of the Canadian Water Ski Association (now Water Ski and Wakeboard Canada) and was editor of the sports newsletter.
In his hometown of Owen Sound, Charlie learned to ski beginning in 1948 at age 17, with coach "Hump" Taylor. Within two years he was competing in, and winning, tournaments. He went on to win three Canadian championships, the slalom gold medal at the 1953 World Championships held in Toronto, and to ski in various tournaments and shows at Cypress Gardens as well as the CNE ski show.
Charlie was a quiet, unassuming man who didn't boast of his many accomplishments. A 1950 story relates that Charlie, as a grade 13 student, initially declined a trip to the World Championships at Cypress Gardens: He thought it might interfere too much with his school work. But the officials of the meet cabled him urging his acceptance and he finally accepted.
By 1958 Blackwell had to curtail his CNE show skiing when his twin girls were born. Charlie worked for Kodak of Canada for 33 years, eventually retiring from that job but then purchasing and operating Pointe au Baril Marina near the family cottage on Harris Lake. At the cottage he taught his four daughters to ski - they were amazed that dad skied but never got wet - and from the marina he took a hand in advising many more would-be skiers how to get going. "We never felt we had to surpass him", says 4th daughter Sandra Blackwell. "He never pushed, he just taught."
He would relate only snippets of his athletic prowess to his family, preferring to tell unassuming stories, like the time he skied into a boathouse and broke his nose. In 1967, Charlie accepted an invitation to attend Expo '67 in Montreal, taking along his young family, and accepted a gold medal recognizing his triumph of fourteen years earlier. This event was the first clue his children got that their dad had ever done anything 'special'.
He went on skiing at the cottage until he was in his mid-50's. His wife, Mary Lou, died in August 1991, by which time the four daughters (Robin, Carol, Karen and Sandra) had given Charlie over ten grandchildren. Sandra reports Charlie wished for 'an even dozen', a wish which later came true. But eventually Charlie developed cancer, and died March 28, 1994. Three days before the end, he told Sandra that he could never complain about leaving because his life had been such an adventure - and he was ready for his next adventure.
Jeremy Kovak
Jeremy Kovak is a pioneer in wakeboarding, which is regarded today as one of the world's fastest growing water sports. Now only 30-years-old, he enjoyed a stellar career on the pro circuit and was a responsible for the maple leaf flying highest at competitions around the world.
In 1993, Kovak became the first Canadian to win a world wakeboard title (which he repeated in 1997) and in 1997 captured the World Cup crown as well. He has also triumphed at Masters, the X-Games and the World Extreme Cup. He posted more than 30 wins on the Pro Tour. During those years he had a heated and popular rivalry with American Darren Shapiro.
''Wakeboarding is in an exciting period right now and sometimes I wish I was still competing,'' said Kovak. ''It's just getting bigger and bigger. I think the appeal for the youngsters is that it's an extreme sport and has so many variables. They're really into the sport and are also real fans of the sport. I got involved initially because I loved doing flips and doing acrobatics in general.''
Kovak was also a star on the Canadian junior water ski team from 1988 to 1991 earning the world junior crown in 1990. He still holds Canadian water ski records. After retiring in 2000, he wrote an instructional wakeboard book, which he is currently promoting and selling.
Career Highlights
Was World champion in two disciplines: 1990 - World Junior Water Ski Champion in Jump before 'switching' to wakeboarding, becoming 1997 World Wakeboarding Champion (first Canadian to ever win a world wakeboarding crown)

Beth Leboff
Leboff grew up in Montreal and her family had a home on a lake in the Laurentian Mountains. ''All I ever wanted to do was water ski,'' she said. ''I learned to barefoot initially with some friends and I found it exciting and challenging. My parents hooked me up with a proper coach so I would be safe.''
She won the national slalom title in 1991 and swept gold in overall, jump, slalom and tricks at the 1992 nationals. She was the Quebec Water Ski Federation's athlete of the year in 1991 and 1992. After the 1992 worlds she went to law school and today is a practicing attorney in Fort Lauderdale. She and her husband Scott McCullough have two young children.
Beth Leboff grew up in Montreal. Her family had a home on a Lake in the Laurentians where they spent our weekends, and is where her Waterskiing began. Also, she attended summer camps as a child where all she wanted to do was Waterski. Beth learned to barefoot with some friends initially off a kneeboard with none of the right equipment.
Beth found Barefooting exciting and very challenging. At the time (mid 80's) it seemed to be a daredevil/extreme sport. Once her family realized she was not going to give up on the pursuit of learning to barefoot, and that Beth was quite serious about it they felt that a proper coach might be the way to keep Beth safe.
Her first coach was Steve Merritt. Steve taught Beth the foundation which led to many successes. Steve also showed her that to be a success it is not only about talent. She had to be prepared for hard work, training, dedication and focus which was imperative to accomplishing the goals that they mapped out together. Beth would travel back and forth to Florida to train when not in school in Montreal.
Eventually Beth learned to jump with the coaching of Mike Siepel and Casey Scalise. Jumping to Beth, was the ultimate although she never lost respect for the ramp and the danger it presented.

Joel McClintock
Joel McClintock has been successful in water skiing as a competitor, coach, author, television commentator and businessman.
In competition, McClintock was part of the world's most successful family in the sport, which included his sister Judy, who'll also be one of the first seven inductees into the Water Ski & Wakeboard Canada Hall of Fame. He learned to water ski at age three, competed for the first time at five and won his first national title at 11. The highlight of his senior level career was winning the overall title at the world championships in 1979. He competed at five worlds in total. He was inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame.
''Winning the world title was a huge deal for me because the sport was my whole life up to that point,'' he said. ''That was my focus from the time I was 12-years-old. Nothing else mattered. Fortunately for me many other wonderful things happened to me afterwards including my involvement with the national team as a coach.''
As a coach, McClintock guided Canada to the world team title in 1991 and 1993 and was a three-time winner of the Coaching Association of Canada's Excellence Award. In addition, he authored The Complete Instructional Book of Waterskiing, produced an instructional videotape on the sport, was host of Watersports World, a nationally syndicated TV program for three years and provided expert sis on TV for major events such as the Masters.
He currently operates Palm Beach Water Sports, a water skiing school in Florida.

Judy McClintock-Messer
Judy McClintock-Messer’s numbers speak for themselves. She won world titles 10 years apart (1985 in tricks and 1995 in overall and tricks), broke Canadian records 48 times and still holds the tricks mark today, was on the national team for 19 years (1978-1996) and competed at every world championships during those years-.an international record. She also won 30 national crowns and claimed four Masters titles. Incredibly, when she retired in 1996 she was only 33-years-old.
‘’Water skiing was a big activity in our family spearheaded by my parents,’’ recalled McClintock-Messer, the youngest of five children and the only girl. Three of her brothers were on the national team as well. ‘’We were lucky enough to have competitive water skiers living close by, so we got involved in that. By the time I was nine I won my first national title. I was geared towards competition right from the start.’’
Of course with such a record, you would think McClintock-Messer ate, slept and drank water skiing. However she married Perry John Messer at age 22 in 1985 and they launched successful fitness business in Northampton, Massachusetts and started a family. That didn’t slow McClintock-Messer at all. She kept winning in water skiing, the business thrived and they had three children.
McClintock-Messer and her brother Joel McClintock were the first siblings to win world titles and they also helped end the American’s 40-year-reign in the team event at the 1991 worlds. Today McClintock-Messer is an avid runner who participates in many events such as the Boston Marathon.

The Judy McClintock-Messer Story
Judy McClintock Messer's athletic career as a waterskier is pure fairytale material. Born to Doctor J.P. McClintock (D.D.S.) and Joyce McClintock, Judy is the youngest of five children and the only girl.
Judy grew up in a very competitive environment with four brothers, three of whom are also avid waterskiers. With an early start to waterskiing at age 3 and a competitive career starting at age 8, Judy showed promise to being one of Canada's elite athletes.
By age 10, Judy, known affectionately as Buff because of her resemblance to Buffy in t.v.'s Family Affair, was competing and winning at the national level. There was no turning back. Judy rapidly progressed through all levels of competition and consistently came out on top, even in fields of competitors much her senior in age and experience.
Judy was showing signs of her world champion potential. In 1979 McClintock represented Canada at the World Championships. She would continue this responsibility for the next 16 years, skiing in more World Championships than any other athlete in the sport. By the mid '80s, Judy was strongly established as an International force, having won the prestigious U.S. Masters overall title and trick title in 1981 as well as many other Pan American and World medals.
In 1985, Judy proved herself the best in the world by winning the gold medal in women's tricks at the World Championships in Toulouse, France. Having reached that pinnacle that few athletes ever achieved Judy could have easily rationalized retirement. By then she had married, supported her husband's efforts to start their own fitness business in Northampton, Massachusetts and was looking forward to starting a family. She did all of the above except retire!
From 1985 onward, Judy had her hands full. She would now be a part time athlete while being a full time businesswoman and mother. And as would be expected Judy excelled at all three. With new priorities in life, Judy the mature athlete wisely focused on select goals.
There were only two things left for Judy McClintock Messer in the sport of waterskiing. The prestigious World Overall Title and the seemingly impossible World Team Title. To date the U.S. had dominated as a team, having never in 40 years of competition, been defeated in the World Championships. In 1991 history was made and Judy reduced her goals by one when Team Canada won the World Team Title in Austria.
Again, to the waterski world, Judy had done it all and this would be the opportune time for this busy and worldly women to bow out. But Judy Messer, like few other athletes, recognizes the inner need beyond the desire to win. Judy is and always has been a contributor. And now a critical part of the World Champion Team this was not the time for Judy to quit. Judy went on to be a prominent member of the 1993 Canadian Team which defended its world title. By 1995, at age 31, many thought Judy had accomplished everything and contributed generously and would surely change her priorities and not show up to perform at the 1995 World Championships.
What these people hadn't considered was that Judy's priorities had changed many years before and that in fact it was her peace of mind combined with unparallel discipline and focus that made it possible to continue to compete among the best in the world even as a part time athlete. 1995 was a year of unprecedented focus for Judy. From early in the season you could see in her eyes that deep inside she had the burning desire and more importantly truly believed that she had the ability to win the coveted world overall title that was the only fragment of prestige and honor that had eluded this champion.
Judy is the epitome of modesty. Never has she or would she talk about this being her year, but somehow, through an air of confidence that Judy exuded throughout the season we knew that she knew that it was her year. And so it was.
Judy pre-empted the World's by using the Canadian Nationals as a stepping-stone at which she managed a clean sweep with gold medals in each of the three events to defend her national overall title. Judy flew to France with the Canadian Team for a week of training to acclimatize and fine tune for the big event. Training went flawlessly. Judy was on track. She went into competition with a level of confidence that even this seasoned athlete had never enjoyed.
From her first event on the water things went great and just kept getting better. Messer was the only female athlete to qualify for the finals in all three disciplines. On Sunday, September 17, 1995, Judy Messer reached yet another pinnacle in the sport of waterskiing as she was crowned World Overall Champion.
Having achieved this honor Judy also established some firsts. Judy is the first Canadian woman to win the World Overall Title. Judy and her brother / teammate / coach Joel McClintock are the first sister and brother to have both won World Titles. Judy Messer retired prior to the 1997 World Championships. She went out in fitting glory after an unprecedented waterskiing career.

Pat Messner
Pat Messner has the distinction of being Canada's only Olympic medallist in water skiing. That happened at the 1972 Games where water skiing was on the program as a demonstration sport. She won the bronze in women's slalom, an achievement that launched a successful international career.
''Being at the Olympics was an amazing experience,'' said Messner, who was coached by her father Joe Messner, a 15-time national champion. They currently run Mesle Canada Water Ski School in Ottawa. ''I wish it could have been granted official status but unfortunately it didn't work out. Still, water skiing remains extremely popular at the participation and that in large parts explains Canada's continued success.''
After the Olympics, Messner ran off a string of firsts for a Canadian woman. She won four world championship medals including the gold in women's slalom in 1979. She was the first Canadian woman to win gold at the Masters Tournament finishing first in slalom in 1978. Messner collected 18 national titles- the first in 1964- and broke Canadian records 19 times. She was on the national team in 1972 and from 1975-80.
Career Highlights
The only Canadian water skier to have won an Olympic medal - she won bronze in the women's s slalom event at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, when water skiing debuted as a demonstration sport.
Following the Olympic medal, she won 4 subsequent world championship medals, including the gold medal in women's slalom in 1979.
Captured 18 Canadian champion titles from 1965 to 1979.

Government Hospitals In Mumbai Helps The City To Stay Fit
By RimTim Staff Writer
October 21, 2016
76
The mega Metropolitan of Mumbai is home to several million people and is celebrated for a busy and glamorous beat of life. A city bustling 24/7, sound healthcare facilities are an innate demand of the populace.
Mumbai is the home of more than a hundred hospitals that constantly cater to the health needs of its people.According to a report by the Public Health Department, Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, specialty and super-specialty health services are provided to the public at a budget of 466 crores per year. There has been establishment of 16 peripheral hospitals, five peripheral hospitals, 26 maternity homes, 163 dispensaries and several other initiatives like post-partum centers, de-addiction clinics, etc.
Hospitals in Mumbai
Mumbai is markedly known for the large number of government hospitals it holds. The hospitals in Mumbai can be divided into three categories:
Private
Municipal
Government
Although all three are superbly efficient in providing healthcare services, it is the last one that has become the savior of the poor.
A major chunk of the population of the city lives in the slums. Unsanitary living conditions, lack of knowledge about hygienic health practices and above all a scarcity in monetary resources render the people a lot of physical ailments. These civilians reach towards the government hospitals which provide treatment for free or at a nominal price.
Government hospitals in Mumbai
The government hospitals in Mumbai offer the rapeutics ranging from first aid and minor surgeries to super specialty treatments under some of the most distinguished minds in the field.
The hospitals provide both medications, as well as a post treatment, follow-up. The fees for the doctor’s appointment as well as for medicines are nominal. The needy patients can be assured of hassle-free, high quality and trustworthy treatment at the lowest possible cost.
The Mumbai government hospitals offer twenty-four-hour free ambulance facility. Tests and diagnostic procedures that normally cost a lot are provided in the government-run medical centers for free. The hospitals also collaborate with local radiology and pathology centers and run tests for free for the poor. In this way, all patients can afford to receive excellent medical attention and health care.
Government hospitals in Mumbai and its increase in statistics
The city of Mumbai is fast expanding since the last few decades. There has been a huge increase in the population due to people moving into the city in search of jobs, education, housing, business, etc. This rise in the number of inhabitants has led to an increase in demand for inexpensive and quality health facilities.
The structural development of the city has also resulted in a large number of vehicles running on the roads every day. As a result, the roads are getting congested and quick movement of vehicles has become a problem. Thus ambulances find it difficult to swiftly reach faraway patients. The government is trying to establish more and more hospitals all around the city to cater to this newly arising need. These hospitals are being sponsored by both the government as well as in collaboration with willing private institutions.
Most people visiting the government hospitals of Mumbai are those of economically weaker backgrounds. Large families’ dependent on few earning members are some of the common patient groups. People living in the slums are also frequent visitors. Diseases are common in these areas due to the infection spreading in closed spaces.
Children and the elderly are the most affected groups. In fact, many Mumbai government hospitals solely provide pediatric care. The children are treated by expert doctors and necessary nutritional plans and medicines are provided to the parents. Young girls and women also have special wards where they are given proper care for any gynecology and birth related issues.
Government hospitals in Mumbai offers several public beneficences
Welfare policy– The government hospitals in Mumbai provide care under all government health policies and schemes. All patients fulfilling prerequisites and seeking care under existing schemes can be assured to receive the best possible service provided.
Under these schemes, the health scenario of the state has greatly improved. As per the Family Welfare Statistics, 2011 report undertaken by the Statistics Division Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Government of India the maternal mortality ratio per 100,000 live births decreased from 166 in 1997-98 to 104 in 2007-09.
Health profile– The hospitals also store and maintain medical history profiles and information for all patients treated by them. This helps in event of necessity of any future reference.
Sponsorship – Moreover, several government hospitals also have systems under which if a patient requires some treatment prescription that is unavailable in the hospital and unaffordable for the patient, then the hospital sponsors the treatment in some other institute. This service comes up as a great benefit for the public.
Public demographic– The Mumbai government hospitals also keep records of disease, birth and death statistics of the population. This is an essential aid in keeping track of general health of the people and intervention the event of epidemics.
Health camp– The hospitals also spread awareness about communicable diseases and provide free medicines whenever necessary. Periodic vaccination camps for both children and adults are set up from time to time. This is also a great aid in service of the people who may not be aware or able to come to the hospital for checkups.
Mobile unit– Another efficient initiative undertaken by the government hospitals is mobile health units. These units serve to offer the first aid and treatment right after some unfortunate episode. This helps to minimize pain and intensity of injury before the hospital is reached. The drive has been able to save hundreds of lives since its inception. A very smart approach to providing ultrafast healthcare, many clinics and private health centers have also now set up such mobile units.
Source of funds of government hospitals in Mumbai
The government hospitals offer medical checkups and treatment to the patients for free or for a nominal price. The rest of the money is compensated by different sources managed by the government. In addition to government hospitals, many private medical institutions in collaboration with the government, also offer treatment to poor people for free. Running mostly on charity and goodwill, these organizations aim to aid the government in catering to the needs of the constantly increasing population.
Several charity programs are also hosted in the city each year that contribute to the cause of health services for the poor. Enthused by celebrity partnership and initiatives by renowned corporations, these events help to raise a lot of awareness and money for building more healthcare centers. Many NGOs in and around the city are also actively involved in the medium of health and welfare. They serve as helping hands of the government and undertake efforts to make sure that each and every citizen receives excellent health benefits and uncompromised care.

Lanna Sirijintakarn’s Unconventional Birthday Has the Chicago Blackhawks Special Hockey Team Giving Thanks
By Administrator on November 18, 2017 • ( 1 )
When celebrating a birthday, most pre-school children have a party with family and friends, eat cake and ice cream and receive lots of gifts. But recently, Highland Park Falcons Mighty Mite, Lanna Sirijintakarn, celebrated her 5th birthday in another way…not by receiving, but by giving back.
Lanna still had a fun party at the ice skating rink with family, friends, pizza and cake, but partygoers were asked to forego the gifts for a donation to the Chicago Blackhawks Special Hockey (CBSH) team instead.
On Saturday, November 12th Lanna attended a CBSH team practice and presented their team captain, Tim Adams, with an envelope of checks, totaling $650.
So what was the motivation behind Lanna’s unconventional birthday celebration?
“Lanna is small for her age, and on top of that, she is already dealing with stereotypes that surround being a girl and Asian,” said Ed Sirijintakarn. “With that in mind, as well as her growing passion for hockey, we wanted to come up with a teaching point for her 5th year…that absolutely anybody can play hockey regardless of size, sex, and race, physical or mental disability.”
Lanna has a friend in her Pre-K class who has Down Syndrome. “We asked Lanna if instead of receiving gifts, if it was okay for her friends to donate money to CBSH to give kids like her friend the opportunity to play hockey,” said her father. “She was very excited with the idea and readily agreed.”
When Lanna was 3½, she was bitten by the hockey bug while watching a Chicago Blackhawks game. She told her parents that she wanted to learn “how to skate”.
“We brought Lanna to an ice rink in Skokie thinking she meant figure skating, but instead she pointed over to the kids that were playing ice hockey,” said her mother, Utchavadee Nakpresha.
After learning basic skating with her dad and taking lessons at Heartland Ice Arena, Lanna began skating with the Highland Park Falcons and her passion for the game really grew. Her excitement for the sport has inspired her dad to sign up for adult learn-to-play classes. Her mom is also learning how to ice skate and the family hopes that Lanna’s 1 year old brother will take to the ice too.
Given the Sirijintakarn family’s affection for the sport of ice hockey and Lanna’s friendship with a classmate with Down Syndrome, having the Chicago Blackhawks Special Hockey team be the recipients of Lanna’s birthday gift was a perfect fit.
Lanna’s parents noted, “this was also made possible in part thanks to the educational program offered at Lanna’s school, Children’s Care and Development Center in Lincolnwood which includes special needs children in the classroom. By teaching kids to socialize and empathize with other kids with physical and mental disabilities, they learn that those children can also accomplish great things.”
“Our entire family is looking forward to continually finding ways to contribute to CBSH while also spreading the message that anybody can play ice hockey,” said Ed Sirijintakarn, who was also quick to give much credit and thanks to Lanna’s Pre-K class at Children’s Care and Development Center and her friends in the Thai community for their generosity on Lanna’s behalf.
More about Lanna
Q: What do you enjoy when you are not playing hockey?
Lanna: I like to draw pictures of my friends and family.
Dad: She also enjoys reading, playing board games, having friends over, and running around at the park.
Q: What are your hobbies?
Lanna: Violin!
Dad: She has been playing violin for about 2 years and actually performed in her first solo concert right after we went to the CBSH practice to present them with the donation. She also participates in a Hip Hop Dance program.
Q: Do you play any other sports?
Lanna: Gymnastics, tennis, and lacrosse.
Dad: She also takes swimming lessons every week and likes to snowboard during the wintertime.
Q: What jersey number do you wear? Any special reason you picked that number?
Lanna: I wear #9 and play for the Falcons (Highland Park’s Mighty Mites house program.)
Mom: The #9 was randomly given to her, but coincidentally also honors, respects and represents the Thai people’s love for the 9th King of Thailand, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who recently passed away. It is a wonderful number for her to wear!
Dad: Her favorite number is #88 though. I bet you know why!

TransferMate Global Payments, the world’s leading cross-border payments solutions provider has partnered with Laver Cup to become the Official Foreign Exchange Specialist. The agreement will see TransferMate operate as Laver Cup’s exclusive foreign currency provider for all relevant services relating to foreign exchange payments. The international men’s tennis tournament will see Team Europe take on Team World in Chicago on September 21 – 23. The highly anticipated second edition of the Laver Cup features the world’s best tennis players including Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Juan Martin del Potro and Kevin Anderson.
The Laver Cup is named in honor of Rod Laver, the Australian tennis legend, who is the only man to win two calendar-year Grand Slams and is recognized as one of the greatest tennis players of all time. The Laver Cup is played over three days with four matches each day – three singles and a doubles. Both singles and doubles matches are the best of three sets with ad scoring where the winning team must reach 13 points. Matchups will be determined prior to the first match each day through the exchange of lineup cards by the captains.
TransferMate Co-Founder and Group CFO, Sinead Fitzmaurice said:
TransferMate is thrilled to announce its partnership with Laver Cup. We are excited they have chosen us to process their foreign currency payments and collections, not only in the US but globally. This partnership is the perfect fit for our global expansion. I am confident that TransferMate’s secure end-to-end international payment solution, utilizing our global banking network, will be of huge benefit to Laver Cup and I wish them every success.’’
Managing Director Steve Zacks said.
We are delighted to partner with TransferMate – they are a perfect match for the Laver Cup, which is a truly global event,”
Every year we not only bring together the world’s best players from across Europe and the rest of the world, we also stage the event in a different country and city. We were in Prague in 2017, are in Chicago this year, and will be in Geneva, Switzerland in 2019. “TransferMate will help us in our day-to-day business operations. It’s great to partner with an organization that like us, is able to work seamlessly across many continents and time zones. We look forward to a great relationship.”

What We Like
Coochiemudlo Island is one of Brisbane's best kept secrets! It's a small island in the southern part of Moreton Bay, Queensland with a population of less than a thousand people
Coochie Island Beach Resort is a tranquil oasis set amidst lush, tropical gardens just metres from the calm waters and golden sands of Coochiemudlo Island’s main beach
The unspoilt sandy beaches provide safe swimming with the southern beach (main beach) patrolled by the surf lifesaving association
Beach picnics, sunset walks and dips in the ocean make for the perfect romantic island getaway without having to travel overseas!

OH MY GOD!!! If there is one thing you must do before you die, it is see Coochie Island Resort - a paradise of simply divine parameters. The food was heavenly delectable, the water beautifully pure and clear, the sand soft and supple under my hands. Never wanted to leave. 9/10"TripAdvisor
Absolutely loved our time on Coochie Island. We stayed here over Christmas after a few nights in Brisbane and had an amazing time. There is always a quiet piece of beach to relax on, and the rest of the time we swam in the resort pool."TripAdvisor
This little gem was full last weekend due to success with a weekend special on Cudo. Arriving at the resort after a short ferry ride on Friday afternoon we sat by the pool for an interesting selection of tails for happy hour. All meals were included in the deal and we were pleasantly surprised by the menu for dinner which was actually 3 courses. We had the prawn tail and stuffed mushrooms, listening to fab music from the BeeGees who apparently spent some time growing up on the island."TripAdvisor

The next morning we had banana pancakes for breakfast. I left quite some stuff with Jaclyn and Daniel, like my bear spray, the Canada Park Pass, some food, the room spray and such. They could use it and I didn´t have space for it anyway or didn´t need it anymore. At about 11 I took off to the ferry terminal at Departure Bay. The ferry was a bit delayed and I had to wait in line with my black car in the blazing sun. But then we finally boarded and I went straight to the sun deck. It´s so much nicer to be on the ferry in nice weather. I really enjoyed the ride.
When I got off the ferry my tank display said range 65 km but within 5 min it dropped to 0 and blinked frantically. So I got off the highway at the next opportunity with a petrol station and put another $10 worth of petrol in it. Just to be safe. Was the most expensive petrol on this trip so far with 134.9. When I had this 7 liters of petrol in the car, the display showed a range of 200 km again. Very accurate this shitty car! You can totally rely on that! Anyway, after this incident I managed to get to my new AirBnB place in Vancouver. It was even possible to park for free on the street there. I had checked for that while booking, but was anyway surprised that something like this exists in a city like Vancouver. I had a little nap and cooked the rest of my supplies. Was a bit a weird combination, but the stuff had to go. After that I took the Skytrain from Oakridge to Downtown and walked from there to the Waterfront and Canada Place where they were celebrating the 150th Canada Day with a concert and stuff. There were soooo many people, it was crazy. But the band was good and the view over the cruise ships to the mountains was really nice. I hang out there for a while and then walked over to the Plaza of Nations on the other side of downtown where I knew that a dance event would take place.
A couchsurfer named Vince told me about that. Shortly after 8 pm they started their program with a Zumba warm up of about 10 minutes, followed by a beginner salsa class that I took just for fun and then social dancing to salsa and bachata. All for free. In the beginning there were not too many good dancers, but it got better with time and I had some really nice dances. I also met Vince, who is sitting in a wheel chair, but is a passionate dancer anyway and very sportive in general playing tennis and everything. Was a first time for me though dancing with someone in a wheelchair. Not so easy since he has to do all the leading with his upper body and also work the wheel chair at the same time, but he did a really good job! At 10:15 I left the dancing place to get to the other side again since I wanted to see the fireworks. Got the number of another dancer before I left to make sure I would be informed about what´s going on dance wise in Vancouver when I would come back from the Yukon. Apparently this part of Vancouver is not the nicest one, there were a lot of creepy people on the streets and I felt a bit scared walking there alone in the dark, had a bit of a horror movie feeling to it. At one point I passed a group of 3 girls and overheard that they are also heading for the fireworks, so I just asked them if they would mind if I stick to them since it was so creepy to walk alone. They were super nice and we went to the fireworks together, watched them together and after they invited me to come to the silence disco with them.
I was super tired though and knew that I would have to wake up early the next day to return the car and catch my flight, so I declined. They escorted me to the next skytrain station and explained exactly where I had to go. I was super happy about that since I would have probably queued up at the wrong line. We left the fireworks just before it was over and I already had bought my ticket back when I was heading to downtown so I got to the train pretty fast even with all these people around. The train was packed though. Walking home from Oakridge station was not so creepy anymore. Unfortunately the people in the house were super loud for another few hours so I didn´t get exactly a lot of sleep until I had to get up early the next morning.

On living under a hyperreal sky
By Giovanni Tiso	
229 Summer 2017
On the morning of 11 August 1993, my partner and I took a train and then a bus from Milan, where we lived, to Courmayeur, an alpine town near the French border. We didn’t book any accommodation, but headed with our blankets a little way up Mont Blanc, in search of an open space protected from the lights of the city.

In a world marked by pain and damage, it’s difficult to put down our shields. Most of us have them; I have several. Usually we are born with them, but sometimes we make them. We hold these shields in front of our faces, to protect ourselves from the pain of others.

On sovereignty
By Tony Birch	
229 Summer 2017
Four years ago, the federal government embarked on an expensive branding and education campaign to convince Aboriginal people and broader Australian society that we should be given formal ‘recognition’ in the constitution. No wording was formalised and the process remained vague at best, and many Aboriginal communities remained sceptical of a proposal regarded as nothing more than a symbolic gesture.

A quest for critique

Crystal Quest is a 1987 action game for the Apple Macintosh. The word ‘quest’ implies some kind of drawn-out chivalric expedition in search of an elusive goal, but this videogame’s design is simpler: moving the mouse, you pilot a hockey-puck-like spaceship around the screen, collecting star-shaped crystals.

Indefatigable wings
By Allan Drew	
229 Summer 2017
My pilgrimage to Milton’s cottage began with my first experience of Paradise Lost. I say ‘experience’ because my initial exposure to the poem wasn’t in print, but rather through an audio book. I listened to it – all 10,000 lines of verse – in my car driving to and from work. Milton, I like to think, let me come to him.

229 Summer 2017
On 15 October 2007, my partner was arrested for terrorism. This came as a shock, as I hadn’t been aware of any nefarious activities. This sense of disbelief continued in the years that followed, during which we hoped the charges would be dropped and my partner would avoid prison.

Sleeping the deep, deep sleep
By Dean Biron and Suzie Gibson	
229 Summer 2017
December 1972. Edward Gough Whitlam is elected as Australia’s first Labor prime minister in twenty-three years. In the United States, the Watergate scandal is smouldering, and former president Harry Truman, the man responsible for the 1945 nuclear strikes on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, dies aged eighty-eight.
It’s also the month of Apollo 17, the final NASA mission to the moon. The two astronauts who land on the surface, Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt, busy themselves collecting various soil and rock samples, driving around in a lunar rover and setting off explosives for a ‘seismic profiling experiment’.

Australia’s custodial culture
By Natalie Cromb	
229 Summer 2017
Since first contact, Indigenous people have been viewed as a problem that needs to be solved.
This viewpoint, rooted in ethnocentric colonialism – a form of cultural supremacy in which specific cultural groups strive to make the world in their image – remains pervasive over 230 years later. It’s visible in the current epidemic of child removals (Indigenous children are eleven times more likely to be removed from their families, and one in five lives with a state-appointed carer) and in Australia’s abhorrent detention statistics (Indigenous children are twenty-six times more likely to end up in juvenile detention than their non-Indigenous peers).

We need more mediocre women!
By Maura Edmond and Jasmine McGowan	
229 Summer 2017
Look, it hasn’t been a great year for women artists. But let’s be frank: it very rarely is.
In January, the Australian Book Review launched its inaugural Gender Fellowship, which asked a writer to produce an article on gender in contemporary Australian letters, only to later decide that none of the applicants had met the criteria ‘in sufficiently new or compelling ways’. Leaving aside ABR’s poor judgement in launching a gender fellowship dictating recipients must write about gender issues, the magazine then announced that the initial applicants weren’t good enough on International Women’s Day.

One of three banned books
By Lachean Humphreys	
229 Summer 2017
Euthanasia remains a polarising topic. It garners popular support, incites expert opposition and sparks heated water-cooler discussions in offices around the country. Why? Because death is the one issue that affects everyone.
Euthanasia is illegal in Australia (with the recent exception of Victoria). While it’s not a crime to take your own life, it’s a crime to assist in the act. For a brief period, the Northern Territory’s Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 permitted assisted dying – the first law in the world to do so – but was later voided by the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997, a move by the federal parliament to bring the matter back under its jurisdiction.

A library for the future
By Brooke Boland	
229 Summer 2017
To talk about the future, you have to first imagine there is one. This is a lesson learnt by some of the more intuitive among us – the fiction writer, say, who looks at the state of the world and traces the contours of a future path that is only, just now, a distant possibility. It’s a path carved from the imagination, but with both feet firmly planted in the present. Jump forward 50, 100, 1000 years, and in the writer’s imagination you will find our planet’s destruction, or maybe its future hope.

Her
By CR McKeogh	
229 Summer 2017
May
I knock on the door at exactly 9am, and she opens it a few seconds later. Her clothes are all wispy layers of black and she has bright red hair clipped up on top of her head and lipstick the same colour as her hair. She is far more beautiful than I had imagined when we talked on the phone, but also far more anxious – her hands flutter to and from her face as she shows me around, and she apologises constantly for the mess, even though the house is spotless.

Infiltration
By SJ Finn	
229 Summer 2017
Lying still, Skilton imagines little robotic Pac-Men chomping through the inflamed tissue along her spine. Their mouths, almost half the size of their heads, are gobbling up everything that hurts, swallowing the big glob of shadow she remembers from her X-rays. It’s like they jumped from one of the machines they’ve put in all the pubs and landed in her back, devouring her pulpy tissue like they do ghosts.

Freedom
By Alice Melike Ulgezer	
229 Summer 2017
Outside, night had fallen. The low rolling plains were blind with snow and the trees stripped of any shelter. There was a small building ahead, visible in the cone of the truck’s headlights. A trail of footprints had sunk in the grubby white, and exhaust fumes dissipated in whirling drifts. Karl could only imagine all of this. A blindfold had been tied around his head.

Hence, please use the service in a responsible manner and reply to their offer, even if you decide not to accept it for any reason.

More advice for a successful project
Please consider that a well-written request receives more and better quotes. Hence, try to write a clear project description. You may take use of the pre-defined questions to add as much information as possible about your job. In addition, please use the free-text box to give your own description.
Compare quotes, ratings and qualifications
Once you have been put in contact with interested providers you are able to compare them. You are given the company details and reviews from previous clients they have won through Servicestart. Make sure to ask the company for any additional qualifications needed such as professional licenses and certificates.
Book an appointment
A personal meeting will give you the chance to ask questions directly to the provider and to evaluate how suitable they would be for your job. The meeting will also allow the provider to better calibrate their offer and price estimate to you. Many providers cannot give an exact price quote unless given the chance to meet and evaluate the project on-site. Of course, this mainly applies to building projects.
Select your provider and sign a contract
Once you feel confident you have found the right provider it is important that the job is performed according to expectations. Make a detailed agreement with your provider to cover time schedule, type and level of remuneration, inspection and quality control and guarantees. Here are more tips
Good luck with your project!

Self-care techniques
Updated On Jan 20, 2017 Published On January 31, 2014 Written By Shari Feuz
You don't need to go to a spa to reduce your stress levels. Get stress relief at home with our DIY self-massage techniques.
The hustle and bustle of the daily routine can frazzle our minds and tie our muscles up in knots. These do-it-yourself self-care techniques and soothing herbal remedies provide at-home relaxation—no massage therapist required. Valentine’s Day is a great time to pamper yourself with a little TLC.
Everyday stressors
Our body doesn’t know the difference between good and bad stress, but late nights, unhealthy food choices, and hectic work schedules help to elevate our stress levels.
Physical and emotional stress can manifest in the body a number of ways:
tension headache
eye fatigue
sore legs and feet
stiff neck
achy back and shoulders
digestive problems
low energy
insomnia
Massage for stress relief
Massage therapy is one of the most widely used approaches to managing muscle stiffness, aches, and pains. It also reduces physiological stress responses including elevated blood pressure, cortisol, and heart rate as well as perceived stress and anxiety.
Be your own masseuse
With our tight schedules and obligations, it can be a challenge to fit in a visit to your massage therapist; however, simple self-care techniques can keep you supple until you can book a session with professionally trained hands.
Petrissage
To release stress and open up healthy circulation throughout your body, massage therapist Derek Woodske suggests a massage technique called petrissage. The movements of petrissage involve various ways of kneading, rolling, and picking up the skin and muscles.
It promotes circulation as well as drainage of both surface and deep tissues. “Helping release the calves will do wonders to help you relax,” says Woodske. “Petrissage will release the strong tensions developed from standing and moving.”
Roll away the stress
“Rolling out your muscles will refresh and energize them,” says kinesiologist Arysta Bogner-Wood, who specializes in myofascial release techniques. Self myofascial release using foam rollers has become increasingly common to supplement traditional massage. Bogner-Wood recommends using a foam roller on the legs and back before and after a long day on your feet.
Light touch
Somatic movement educator and manual therapist Sue Hitzmann focuses on the connective tissue of the body, not on muscle. Connective tissue is a fluid-based system, and Hitzmann suggests that dehydration is the underlying cause of daily aches, stiffness, cramps, and strain. Hitzmann recommends light touch self-care techniques to restore hydration to connective tissue.
Hydrotherapy for revitalization
“Hydrotherapy is amazing for reviving tired and fatigued hands and forearms,” says Canmore, Alberta-based massage therapist Robyn Feuz. Hydrotherapy uses alternating hot and cold muscle soaks to flush out toxins and bring nutrients to the area.
Reflex the stress away
Self foot reflexology has been shown to be very successful in reducing perceived stress and fatigue. This type of massage stimulates areas of the feet to help relax and rejuvenate other areas of the body, including the glands and organs.
Soothe your stress with herbs
There are many herbs that can be relaxing. “I focus on pleasant, aromatic herbs used as infusions,” says master herbalist Nathaniel Whitmore. “Besides the benefit from ingesting the herb, there is an aromatherapeutic effect, and simply drinking a hot beverage has benefit.”
“The aromatic mints, including peppermint, lemon balm, bee balm, catnip, and lavender, are particularly good. Rose and camomile are also delightful additions,” he says.
Whitmore also recommends the use of herbal tinctures: “My favourites for preventing stress are motherwort, hops, and valerian.” Herbs such as ginseng, Siberian ginseng, rhodiola, licorice, and medicinal mushrooms are more building and energizing when stress is due to “running on empty.”
Nutritional biochemist Shawn Talbott includes magnolia bark, ashwagandha, and pine bark among his most effective antistress herbs.
Try these self-care techniques and remedies to relax, rejuvenate, and prevent burnout.
DIY self-care treatments to relieve stress
Petrissage for headaches
Start by cupping neck in hands, letting fingers gently touch and knead soft tissue along cervical spine.
Using gently increasing pressure, squeeze and release in milking fashion from tops of trapezius muscle to base of skull.
Cucumber hydrotherapy for tired eyes
Place fresh cucumber slices on ice for 10 minutes (do not freeze).
Place slices over eyes, lie down, and relax for 10 minutes or more. Remove slices.
Using pads of fingers, start at corner of eye at the nose and begin small gentle compressions, one finger width apart, over eyebrows and around and under the eyes.
Hydrotherapy hand and arm treatment
Prepare 2 tubs with water, one hot (as tolerable) and one cold (as tolerable).
Soak hands and arms in hot water for 3 minutes (up to the shoulder if tub is large enough). Wait 1 to 2 minutes.
Place arms in cold water for 1 minute.
Repeat 2 to 4 times.
Finish with a warm soak, then apply massage oil or lotion.
Start at wrist and using thumb, compress forearm muscle with deep pressure, moving toward the elbow.
Repeat 5 to 10 times.
Flush area with soft soothing strokes toward shoulder.
Small ball foot release
Using small, firm ball (tennis ball-size), work through arch of foot, heel, and toes.
Create compression and stretch on toes for 1 to 2 minutes per foot.
Petrissage for exhausted legs
Take one calf at a time and gently work from ankle to knee, gently kneading.
Increasing pressure, squeeze and release in milking fashion.
Basic foot rub revamped
Place fingers between each toe and create small circular motions with forefoot.
Then squeeze toes around fingers to aid in better circulation to the forefoot.
Mini rolling routine
Using a 4 in (10 cm) diameter foam roller, you can perform this five-minute mini rolling routine any time. Perform it at the start of the day and again at day’s end to relieve an achy back, shoulders, or legs.
Calf and hamstring release
Place foam roller under one calf muscle.
Supporting body with arms, roll leg over roller, starting from ankle.
Use gentle, slow rolling actions with static pressures, gradually working up calf toward knee.
Then gradually work back of thigh up to buttocks.
Repeat on the other leg.
Upper back release
While sitting on floor, lean back onto foam roller, placing roller at bottom of shoulder blades.
Use gentle, slow rolling actions, gradually working from upper back to neck.

10 Self Confidence Tips For Women
By Farah_Risoen
If you're going through midlife changes, life transitions, or just need a boost, here are 10 simple self-confidence tips to help you start living your best life:
1. Give Thanks
Consciously focus on what you can appreciate in your life right now. Look at anything in your life that you can be grateful for and give thanks for having it!
2. Upgrade Your Wardrobe
I know...Clothes don't really make the woman, but they sure can impact how she feels about herself... Start wearing clothes that make you feel good about yourself. This doesn't mean you have to spend a ton of money! Go shopping in your own closet first and see what you have! You can always add to your wardrobe by buying a few quality classic items like a white shirt, a black dress, a good pair of jeans, etc. Then you can create different looks by mixing and matching your tops and bottoms and using various accessories (earrings, belts, scarves, shoes, etc.) Remember, when we look good it affects how we carry ourselves and interact with others. So dress sharp, take care of your personal appearance, and have fun with it.
3. Work Out
Always take care of your physical body by exercising and eating well! This is definitely one of the best things you can do for yourself and boost your self-confidence. Make a list of activities you enjoy: walking, hiking, yoga, dancing, going to the gym, swimming, running, tennis, biking, weight training, etc. Then do something active every day! Not only will this help you feel good about yourself, but it will give you more energy and improve your mood.
4. Stand Up Tall
Be conscious s of your posture at all times. Stand tall with your head up and shoulders back. Breathe from your diaphragm, smile and relax. This alone would automatically make you feel more confident!
5. Walk with Purpose
People who are confident and know where they're going walk faster than other. Pick up your pace and walk quickly with purpose as if you know exactly where you're going!
6. Listen/Read inspirational material
Get in the habit of reading positive quotes, magazine, books, materials, and/or listening to uplifting music, or motivational CDs. Feed your mind by surrounding yourself with positive people, images, and messages.
7. Write a New Story
Write a new story about you and your life. Moving forward, decide who you intend to be; how to intend to act; what you intend to have and create; who you want in your life; and what empowering beliefs, habits, and thoughts you intend to reinforce. Write 2-3 paragraphs about your new story and life.
8. Give Compliments
As you go through your day, start giving genuine compliments to others without expecting one back. This forces you to look for the good and positive in people, which will bring out the good and positive in you. Give at least 3 authentic compliments a day.
9. Use Your Voice
Make an effort to speak up at least once a day in group discussions at work or with friends/family. Remember, what you have to say is just as important as what some else has to say! So use your voice and speak up whenever you want to!
10. Make a difference
Stop focusing on you and your life all the time! Shift your focus to contributing and making a difference in someone else's life. Volunteer your time as little or as much as your schedule allows. Find an organization or cause that you are passionate about, and reach out and support them. The more you give to the world, the more the world will give back to you.

ADVERTISING FEATURE Of all the things to tick off your back to school list – haircuts, uniforms, books and bus tickets - perhaps the most important to the comfort of your child’s feet, and a happy school day, is new shoes. You can’t buy them too early mind you, because growth spurts can throw your plans into disarray, but if your child’s feet aren’t comfy, it’s thumbs down for the school day and the three Rs. Considering how long those tootsies spend in school shoes, a serious attempt to buy the right shoe at the right time is in order. Do you remember your mum pressing firmly on your big toe, to see how much room your feet had? We know that, though the shoe had a good four inches of space left and produced a slippery, sloppy, shuffle at best, she was hoping those shoes would ‘last’ until at least June, before having to be replaced. This advertising feature is sponsored by the following business. Click the link to learn more: So how do you pick the right school shoe for your child? A visit to the shoe shop a few weeks before school goes back, is in order. Sometimes you will fluke a sales assistant eager to share their insider knowledge on the mysteries of correctly fitting shoes, but if you don’t here’s some words of advice from the Australian Podiatry Association. “All shoes should support and protect your children’s feet. To ensure their shoes fit properly, measure regularly for length and width; so the shoe fits the natural shape of their foot, especially around the toes. “Specifically, the toe of the shoe should allow your child’s toes to move freely and not be squashed from the top or the sides. Make sure there is about one centimetre growing room between the end of their longest toe and the top end of their shoe. Also bear in mind that shoes should fit comfortably around the heel, and not be too loose or too tight.” Today the new shoe business has expanded to include footy boots, running shoes and even tennis shoes; so you could be facing four times the amount of shoes for each child. Our kid’s feet don’t stop growing just because of budget blowouts.

Giving feet space to grow
A good fit: Because children's feet grow so quickly, all you can hope for is to have their new shoes leave enough space for comfort and support. In six months time, you may be doing it all again.

ADVERTISING FEATURE
Of all the things to tick off your back to school list – haircuts, uniforms, books and bus tickets - perhaps the most important to the comfort of your child’s feet, and a happy school day, is new shoes.
Your shoe investment is going to take some keeping up with.
You can’t buy them too early mind you, because growth spurts can throw your plans into disarray, but if your child’s feet aren’t comfy, it’s thumbs down for the school day and the three Rs.
Considering how long those tootsies spend in school shoes, a serious attempt to buy the right shoe at the right time is in order.
Do you remember your mum pressing firmly on your big toe, to see how much room your feet had?
We know that, though the shoe had a good four inches of space left and produced a slippery, sloppy, shuffle at best, she was hoping those shoes would ‘last’ until at least June, before having to be replaced.

So how do you pick the right school shoe for your child?
A visit to the shoe shop a few weeks before school goes back, is in order. Sometimes you will fluke a sales assistant eager to share their insider knowledge on the mysteries of correctly fitting shoes, but if you don’t here’s some words of advice from the Australian Podiatry Association.
“All shoes should support and protect your children’s feet. To ensure their shoes fit properly, measure regularly for length and width; so the shoe fits the natural shape of their foot, especially around the toes.
“Specifically, the toe of the shoe should allow your child’s toes to move freely and not be squashed from the top or the sides. Make sure there is about one centimetre growing room between the end of their longest toe and the top end of their shoe. Also bear in mind that shoes should fit comfortably around the heel, and not be too loose or too tight.”
Today the new shoe business has expanded to include footy boots, running shoes and even tennis shoes; so you could be facing four times the amount of shoes for each child. Our kid’s feet don’t stop growing just because of budget blowouts.
As well, their sport of choice could turn from footy boots to netball trainers overnight; either way, your shoe investment is going to take some keeping up with.
School rules on shoes have saved you from having to choose the colour, heel height and what it is made of. Standardisation does save headaches when you have school children.

Why Those ‘Suffragette’ T-Shirts are a Racial Slap
By

October 6, 2015
There are so many women (and a number of men, if we’re really being honest) I have come across who are very feminist in thought and practice, but bristle at that term being used in their presence. Sure, some of them have adopted Alice Walker’s “womanism” moniker instead, but plenty of others don’t feel that their approach to gender parity needs a name at all. I’ve always been a little bothered by this; as Iyanla Vanzant famously said let’s “call a thing a thing.” We can’t really challenge sexism unless we acknowledge it exists; living in opposition to it is great, but not enough.
However, when I see Meryl Streep, Carey Mulligan and their fellow cast mates from the upcoming film, Suffragette, posing proudly while wearing shirts that say “I’d rather be a rebel than a slave,” I am reminded that no matter how hard Beyonce, Chimamanda and Melissa Harris-Perry represent for #TeamFeminist, the repugnant stench of White racism is inextricable from the concept for so many people.
Check out Meryl Streep and Carey Mulligan on the cover of @TimeOutLondon this week! More info http://t.co/nZxRwvNFdo pic.twitter.com/y6KWGLDOK4
— SUFFRAGETTE (@SuffragetteFilm) September 29, 2015
Seriously, is there anything more tone deaf than casually putting “slave” on a shirt worn by a bunch of White women? And the idea that we shouldn’t be offended because Emmaline Pankhurst, the originator of the quote was British—because that’s a group of people that have clean hands when it comes to slavery, am I right?—is so…predicable. Peak White Feminism. PEAK!
I won’t spend too much time making the distinction between White feminists and White feminism, because it was so wonderfully broken down by Zeba Blay here, but it’s worth acknowledging that no, silly, we aren’t talking about every White person who identifies as a feminist when we say the latter. However, the distinction needs to be made between those so-called feminists who center White womanhood in their pursuit of gender equality and those who are actually feminist in a way that promotes equity for people of all races, backgrounds, gender expressions, etc.
Here is the full quote, for the “Well, actually” crew that seems to think those of us offended by the shirt are too stupid to understand it: “Know that women, once convinced that they are doing what is right, that their rebellion is just, will go on, no matter what the difficulties, no matter what the dangers, so long as there is a woman alive to hold up the flag of rebellion. I would rather be a rebel than a slave.”
The offense is not at Pankhurst’s words, but that someone could actually think it’s no big deal to put those words on a shirt with a bunch of smiling White actresses promoting a film about a movement that was often times extremely racist and failed to center Black female voices, and for those shirts to be worn for primarily U.K. and U.S. audiences—considering the specific relationship to slavery had by both places.
Alas, it seems the more that feminists of color make noise in the media, the deeper White feminism digs its heels in and refuses to acknowledge the ways that White racism allows them to be privileged, despite still living under the heel of sexism. As hard as I have worked personally to preach the gospel of gender equality (Sex positivity! Equal pay! Access to healthcare!), White feminism shows up like the one cousin who you don’t invite to “nice” family gatherings: loud, ignorant and unapologetically so.
So, an R. Kelly rape joke here and a dismissal of Nicki Minaj’s feelings about racism there. Then a little casual racism posed as jokes that punch down at oppressed people. Or a call for people of color and LGBT people to support women (that really did happen!) A starlet ignoring the significance of Zendaya’s Barbie moment and saying “What about me?”, and a lady mag proclaiming a tribe of women made famous by well-executed plastic surgery and romantic relationships with Black men as “America’s First Family.” And now, American born, highly-educated Meryl Streep at 66 years old, not knowing that the words “rebel” and “slave” (and, really, “rather” and “slave”) have no business together on a tee shirt? White Feminism, ladies and gentlemen.
How dreadful.
I’d like for the White feminists of the world to stand down so that I might be able to reach those who are in need of a consciousness raising without having to explain and apologize for their actions, but I don’t see that happening any time soon. Alas, we soldier on. I’d rather be an intersectional feminist than one who can’t understand or recognize the challenges faced by women of color, despite a history of philanthropy that would suggest otherwise. I’d rather bypass the privilege and have the ability to connect with humans outside a pretty pink White feminist bubble.
Feminism isn’t new, and White feminism for damn sure isn’t new (which is why you won’t be seeing many Black women in Suffragette), but what has changed is the immediate public response to these gaffes. As soon as the Time Out article went live, the Internet let everyone involved have it. Will we see less facepalm moments from White feminism as a result? Time will reveal. But in the meantime, I want my drunken cousins in (nonexistent) feminist solidarity to understand that they simply aren’t the faces or the axis of feminism anymore–and they never were in the first place.

About adidas Superstar
A Classic Design for the Next Generation: adidas Superstar Kids
Originally released in the 1969, the Superstar family is a classic from the adidas vault. During the 1970s, these trainers became a common sight on NBA courts, offering a nice balance of support, comfort and good looks. Now, the Superstar has received an exciting new update in the adidas Superstar Kids edition. Aimed as much at hardcore 'ballers as urban fashion fans, these low-slung trainers blend vintage style and contemporary quality in a way that kids will love.
A Comfortable, Good-Looking Shoe for Sport and Fun
There are plenty of reasons to buy adidas Superstar Kids trainers. For starters, they come with technical features like rubber toe caps, high-quality leather uppers and elasticated laces that are easy for young fingers to tie. Even better, adidas Superstar Kids' shoes come in a wonderfully diverse range of designs. From graphics inspired by Amazonian rainforests to iridescent stripes and brightly coloured monochromatic versions, the Superstar collection features a look to capture the attention of every child.
Footwear for Active Kids
With a tracksuit, adidas Superstar Kids shoes look the part,(especially adidas Trefoil designs) and basketball or tennis kits. So if your child needs something to wear on court, look no further. But the beauty of these trainers is their versatility. Dazzling stripes, vivid prints, and coloured uppers will make them fun to wear with everyday outfits. They should appeal to boys and girls alike, and there are even adidas Superstar Kids' models for pre-schoolers, for those kids taking their first steps in designer footwear. So, whatever style your child prefers, the Superstar Kids range is almost certainly a good fit.
Pick up a Stylish Pair of adidas Superstar Kids Trainers at Foot Locker
At Foot Locker, we always love to show off the latest adidas creations, and this Superstar update is no exception. If your child needs to upgrade their shoes, we offer the whole collection with a dizzying variety of upper designs and colours. And thanks to our regular reductions, parents will love the adidas Superstar Kids price almost as much as their kids enjoy wearing the trainers. So have a look around, browse for pre-school, infant, or junior sizes, and find a pair of shoes with real Superstar qualities.

Rita Ora In Adidas Jeremy Scott Crazy 97 Wedge Sneakers.
Rita Ora was looking all sporty as she made her way towards London hotspot The Little House with her boyfriend Ricky Hilfiger and some friends on Friday night.
She wore a diesel jacket on a crop top with a Diesel Tribute Sport Aquahollic Leggings and finished up with an Adidas Jeremy Scott Crazy 97 Wedge Sneakers.
She accessorized with a Chanel Metallic Blue Leather Vintage Backpack.
It is safe to call her Rihanna's protege in outlandish outfit...anyways her entire ensemble looks awful..
WHERE TO PURCHASE.
Sneakers: purchase at Amazon.

BOYS TENNIS: Elco ousted quickly in L-L semifinals

MYERSTOWN >> The Elco boys tennis team was just happy to be there.
Even knowing what was likely coming its way.
Then again, there are a lot of teams that would have been glad to take the Raiders' place in perennial power Hempfield's line of fire on Monday afternoon.
As has been the case for much of the recent past, Elco qualified for the Lancaster-Lebanon League playoffs and didn't stay there long, courtesy of a Section One heavyweight.
This time, and for the second year in a row, it was the Black Knights, who needed barely 45 minutes to roll past the Raiders, 3-0, in a rain-shortened L-L semifinal matchup at Elco High School.
Now 14-1, Section One runner-up Hempfield quickly swept the two doubles matches, then grabbed the No. 3 singles contest in short order to sew up a trip to Tuesday's league title match against Section One champ Manheim Township, a 3-0 semifinal winner over Cocalico.
Section Two champ Elco (11-2), a state tournament qualifier a season ago, can now focus on the L-L individual tourney that begins on Thursday, and the upcoming District Three Class AA Team Championships, where it will be a likely No. 2 seed; which is pretty much how the Raiders figured it would go when the day began.
"We're just happy to be here," Elco coach Zach Cook said, as he dodged some post-match raindrops. "We always know that Hempfield and Manheim Township are fantastic teams, but it's always fantastic competition and gets us ready for the next level far more than what we'd get from anyone else in Section Two.
"Do we always get our clocks cleaned by Hempfield and Township? Absolutely. But it gets us ready. We're not gonna see a better team than Hempfield all year."
The Black Knights certainly proved Cook right on Monday.
En route to clinching the win, the visitors dropped a grand total of two games in three matches, with Jacob Curtin officially wrapping up the win with a 6-0, 6-0 rout of Dylan Spitler at No. 3 singles. Prior to that, Jay Cooke and Nick Aksu took care of Linden and Mason Bennetch, 6-1, 6-0, at No. 1 doubles, and Andrew Virts and Jack Hessinger cruised past Christian Stahl and Adam Omar, 6-0, 6-1, in the No. 2 match.
The Raiders fared better at No. 1 and 2 singles before the rains came. Adam Bahney trailed Derek Hagino, 4-6, 2-2, at No. 1 singles, while Galen McNaughton was threatening to force a third set at No. 2 singles, locked in a 5-5 second-set tie with Calvin Athey after dropping the first set by a 6-1 score.
"Depth-wise, I'm happy with where we're at. But it'd be nice to be Hempfield," Cook said of the Black Knights' impressive top-to-bottom lineup strength that told the story of Monday's match.
Still, nothing that happened on Monday could take away from what the Raiders have accomplished to date or the district team goals they're still pursuing.
"We're always looking to win a match, but I knew five points was gonna be tough to come by today," Cook said. "But this is great experience for us. It helps us immensely. I love just to be in this match."
Hempfield 3, Elco 0 at Elco
Singles— 1. Derek Hagino (H) led Adam Bahney, 6-4, 2-2 (suspended), 2. Calvin Athey (H) led Galen McNaughton, 6-1, 5-5, 3. Jake Curtin (H) def. Dylan Spitler, 6-0, 6-0
Doubles — 1. Jay Cooke/Nick Aksu (H) def. Linden Bennetch/Mason Bennetch, 6-1, 6-0, 2. Andrew Virts/Jack Hessinger (H) def. Christian Stahl/Adam Omar, 6-0, 6-1

Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) Compensation Claims
HomePersonal Injury Compensation ClaimsAccident at Work Compensation ClaimsRepetitive Strain Injury (RSI) Compensation Claims
If you have sustained a repetitive strain injury (RSI) due to your work or working environment then you may be entitled to compensation.
Employers have a duty to ensure that their employees are protected from health risks in the workplace as far as is reasonably practicable. This could include operating an appropriate rota system so that one person is not doing the same job all of the time, thus reducing the risk of a repetitive strain.
A repetitive strain injury can be in the form of:
frozen shoulder
tennis elbow
carpal tunnel syndrome
tendonitis
tenosynovitis
Typical RSI symptoms can include:
stiffness
weakness
tingling
numbness
cramp
continual aching
sharp pain
Repetitive strain injuries can be caused by:
repeated use of vibrating tools
heavy manual lifting
production line performing repetitive tasks
using a computer or telephone for long periods
poorly designed workspaces
operating machinery
working in confined spaces causing restricted movements
In many cases, symptoms will disappear almost as soon as you have a break (such as a 2 week holiday) from doing the work that is causing the problem but will reappear as soon as you go back to your normal working routine.
Anyone who wishes to make a compensation claim has a period of 3 years in which to do so before Court proceedings have to be issued. The 3 year period is easy to calculate if you have been injured in an accident. With RSI claims, the 3 year period will start to run from the date that you realised that the type of work you have been doing has caused the condition from which you now suffer. Usually, but not always, this date could be when your doctor provides you with a diagnosis.
Contact us
If you, or a loved one, think your work has caused or worsened a repetitive strain injury and you would like to discuss the possibility of making a repetitive strain injury compensation claim please contact our personal injury lawyers on Freephone 0808 164 0808 for a FREE, no-obligation chat or complete the request a call back form and we will call you.

The Chat About Serena’s Wimbledon Outfit Makes Us Angry
rmunson July 7, 2016 10:29 am
Any Wimbledon Tennis fan will know what watching Serena Williams play is an absolute treat.
The 34-year-old US tennis star is ranked number one in the world, and never fails to give a good show when she’s on the court. But when she played her quarterfinal match against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova on Tuesday, Twitter was soon alight with comments not about her game, but about her outfit.
*Sigh*.
Read: The Core Body Workout Serena Williams Swears By….
> Serena looked totally court-appropriate in a white Nike top and tennis skirt
Apparently, Serena’s white Nike top was far too ‘distracting’ for viewers’ sensitive eyes, and they made their complaints clear on social media.
‘Surprised BBC haven’t issued a warning that Serena is showing some nipple today! #Wimbledon’, wrote one tennis fan.
‘I wouldn’t usually comment on another woman’s body, but could someone give Serena Williams something to cover her nipples… very distracting,’ another tweeted.
> Serena will play Russia’s Elena Vesnina on the semi-finals on Thursday after winning the match
A third commented: ‘With all the money Serena Williams earns, why can’t she buy a decent sports bra which covers her nipples properly.’
Sorry, but are we living in the Dark Ages?! Because last time we checked, women could wear whatever the hell they wanted. Not only that, but since when could ANY female on earth control the temperature outside, and how her body reacts to it?
Just no.
> Many viewers tweeted that they found Serena’s top ‘distracting’
A BBC insider has reportedly responded, telling The Sun: ‘Producers have absolutely no say in what the players wear, which has made it difficult for them to avoid eye-popping shots on daytime telly.’
We’re a bit flabbergasted by the whole thing, TBH. We thought Serena dressed totally appropriately for court, and if there are people out there that find a pair of nipples distracting whilst they’re watching a blinding Wimbleon quarterfinal match, then we feel sorry for them.
Serena, you were FABULOUS.
> Distracting? We don’t think so.

Race fairly regularly - handicap is based on your best 5 performances adjusted for course difficulty but weighted towards more recent performances
Train efficiently - see our training section
Join a club or running group
Don't worry if you have a bad race or just take it easy sometimes - only your best 5 adjusted performances count
Don't worry if you race on a tough course or day - our algorithm adjusts for this
The runbritain handicap scoring system is a unique way of measuring your progress and comparing yourself with other runners.
As in golf, handicaps go from scratch (zero, or even slightly negative for elite runners) to 36 with increments of 0.1.
To compute your handicap we take a combination of your recent best performances but adjusted by the "SSS" which is our measure of the course difficulty and weather conditions on the day.
This means that you can improve your handicap at any race as on harder courses you won't need to run quite as quickly as on faster ones. See the Time to Improve Panel for more details.
National Ladder
The National Ladder position given here is your ranking out of all the road runners in the UK of your gender. They are just like the rankings in other sports like golf or tennis. See further down the page where you stand in your age group and out of everybody.
Please login to view handicap scores and ladder positions.
The national ladder positions are an indication of where you stand out of all the road runners in the UK. They are just like the rankings in other sports like golf or tennis.
The values given indicate your Overall position amongst everybody, your position among all Men or Women and (unless you are a senior) your position in your own Age Group.
There are also positions by the postcode "district" of the runner - e.g. the AB12 part of AB12 3CD. If you don't have any postcode rankings we probably don't know your postcode so please login and goto the Account section to enter it.
To compute all these positions, we order everybody's current runbritain Handicap. Updates to the ladder positions are made every week.

Dames Squashkleding
Dames squashkleding kun je bij Squashpoint bestellen in alle soorten, maten en kleuren.
Je kleren vormen een essentieel onderdeel van je squashuitrusting. Het zorgt er niet alleen voor dat je er leuk en verzorgt uitziet op de baan, maar eveneens dat je optimaal kunt presteren. Want met comfortabele squashkleding voel je je prettiger en kun je je beter focussen op de bal.
De dames squashkleding die wij aanbieden op onze website is speciaal ontwikkeld voor racketsporten als squash en tennis waarbij bewegingsvrijheid erg belangrijk is. Je maakt namelijk regelmatig flinke uitstappen naar alle kanten en benut het vloeroppervlak optimaal. Daarom moet dames squashkleding vervaardigd worden uit sterke en flexibele stoffen die tevens comfortabel dragen. Daarnaast is het belangrijk dat dames squashkleding vochtregulerend is omdat squash een sport is waarbij je flink transpireert. De shirts zijn om die reden gemaakt van polyester die de eigenschap heeft snel te drogen. Speciale technologieën als het AeroDry systeem van Dunlop en het ENDOdry systeem van Head zorgen eveneens voor een optimale vochtregulatie. De meeste shirts zijn bovendien uitgerust met zogenaamde mesh panels. Dit zijn stukjes gaasstof die ervoor zorgen dat frisse lucht gemakkelijk door het shirt heen kan stromen, waardoor je lichaam koel blijft. Bij dames squashkleding is het design en de kleur ook belangrijk. Het oog wil natuurlijk ook wat.
De dames squashkleding die wij in ons assortiment hebben, bestaat uit shirts, polo’s, tank tops, shorts en skorts. Dit zijn vlotte rokjes met een geïntegreerd broekje, zodat je vrij kunt bewegen en je ondergoed niet zichtbaar is zoals dat vaak wel het geval is bij een normaal rokje of jurkje. Wij kiezen uitsluitend voor dames squashkleding met een goede pasvorm en hoog draagcomfort. De kleur en het model is veelal een persoonlijke keus. Maar het is natuurlijk altijd leuk als de dames squashkleding die je draagt matcht met je squashtas of je squashracket. Maak je outfit compleet met een nieuwe hoofdband en bijpassende polsbandjes.
Twijfel je over de maat of kun je niet kiezen tussen die twee leuke skorts, bedenk dan dat je geen enkel risico loopt omdat je bij Squashpoint kosteloos kunt retourneren. Het aankoopbedrag wordt direct teruggestort.

There are multiple injuries, including fatalities, in a collision involving a semi and a bus containing a junior hockey league team in Saskatchewan, Canada, according to a report by the CBC.
According to the CBC report, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police confirmed fatalities in the crash that occurred less than 20 miles north of Tisdale, Saskatchewan.
It is unknown how many people were killed or injured in the crash.
The Nipawin Hawks of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League announced on its Facebook page that Friday night's game had been canceled due to accident involving the bus of the opposing team.
Post by nipawin.hawks.
The SJHL is cooperating with the RCMP with the incident involving the
Humboldt Broncos bus and a semi. RCMP investigation is ongoing and until the RCMP can provide the SJHL with facts about the incident; our thoughts and prayers are with the families and all involved.
— SJHL (@theSJHL) April 7, 2018
The Humboldt Broncos were on their way to play the Nipawin Hawks in a SJHL playoff game. The Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League is open to players 20 years of age or younger.
We ask all members of the SaskHockey community to join us in saying a prayer for the the Humboldt Broncos team and their families.

20 Stunning Easter Wreaths
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's Sweetest Moments
We're counting down the days until a royal engagement is announced!
By Caroline Hallemann	
Oct 27, 2017
Most of the famous couple's courtship has been kept under wraps, but here are a few of their cutest moments, captured on-camera.
Advertisement - Continue Reading Below
Their relationship was on display for the first time at the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto.
Prince Harry co-founded the Games back in 2014; Meghan's appearance marks the first time she's accompanied Harry at an official royal engagement.
Meghan and Harry appeared together at the Wheelchair Tennis event.
Here they are having a laugh.
Sharing a secret during the match.
Just a few weeks before this was taken, Meghan revealed details of their relationship in Vanity Fair.
"We're a couple. We're in love. I'm sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time," she said. "This is for us. It's part of what makes it so special, that's just ours. But we're happy. Personally, I love a great love story."
Here they are holding hands for the camera.
They were the picture of a young couple in love.
Prince Harry spent some time with Meghan's mom at the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games
While Meghan was initially seated separately from Harry in a private box with her mother and close friends, he stopped by toward the end of the event to say hello.
A sweet smooch was also caught on camera!
In a rarely seen moment of royal PDA, Prince Harry planted a kiss on his girlfriend's cheek.

Sun City West
August 31, 2011 by irenehammond
Sun City West is the second of the Sun Cities in the NW corner of the Phoenix Valley. Construction and homes sales began in 1978 as the first Sun City sold out. It took until 1997 for Sun City West to complete their build-out. The community boundaries are Bell Rd to the south, Grand Avenue to the east and El Mirage to the west. The new state road 303 curves around the northern boundary. Most of Sun City West is excluded from the Maricopa School Districts, and therefore enjoys lower real estate tax. The lower real estate taxes combined with the low maintenance fees make Sun City West a very desirable location for the retiring active adults on a fixed income. The financial incentive plus the tremendous number of clubs and activities and of course the opportunity to play 9 golf courses all combine to create another extremely desirable 55+ retirement location. The variety of single level home styles, patio homes, and condos offer a wide range of home pricing. Within the community the streets are approved for driving your golf carts and you will find shopping, churches, and banks, drug stores, grocery stores and the Del Webb hospital.

Frequently asked questions
Inclusions - What's included in my one low cruise fare?
Cruising is such a great value holiday as your fare includes accommodations, all main meals onboard ship, onboard daytime activities, and night-time entertainment including live stage shows. One reason cruising is good value is because you'll know what most of your holiday will cost before you go. Generally your only extra onboard expenses could be your beverages (though these are sometimes included on luxury ships), optional shore excursions, personal services such as spa treatments, and any purchases at the gift and duty free shops.
Meals - Are they really that good?
All your main meals are included on a cruise. Typically for breakfast, lunch and dinner there is an a la carte option (order from a menu) or a buffet option. There is so much choice available, and the food is excellent. However, your cruise doesn't always just include these 3 main meals. You can in fact eat non-stop for 24 hours a day if you like.
Most cruise lines also offer specialty dining as an alternative option to the main restaurants. There is typically a small cover charge for this. However, the food is well worth it, and the specialty restaurants are normally smaller and more intimate than the main restaurants so they make for a great place to celebrate a special occasion.
Entertainment - What can I do on board?
The entertainment on board comes in many different styles and formats but is always included in the cruise fare. In the evening there are shows in the main show lounge (except small ship cruising). Typically there are two sessions a night so, depending on your dinner time, you can always catch the show. The style of these shows changes daily. Some nights it will include all of the ship’s entertainment crew with a Las Vegas style production. Other nights there may be a guest entertainer or comedian. There is something for everyone.
The entertainment doesn't stop with the nightly performances. Each night the ship provides a newsletter detailing all the activities that will take place the following day. These activities may include dance classes, arts and crafts, table tennis, live music, tournaments, trivia quizzes, recent release movies, and other deck games and deck parties. The great thing about a cruise is that you can do as much or as little as you like. If your idea of a holiday is sitting back with a good book, you can do that. If you like to be entertained there is no shortage of entertainment.
Kids Club - Does it cost extra? Is there enough for them to do?
One of the main reasons for a cruise making such a great family holiday is the “kids club” facilities offered on board, and they are all included in your cruise fare. Typically the kids clubs are broken into 3 different age groups - 3 to 6 years, 7 to 12 years, and 13 – 17 years. In these dedicated children’s facilities they are looked after by trained staff and the facilities are open from 9am – 10pm. Parents can check their children into the “kids club” whenever it suits them. Children love these facilities as it is “their space” aboard the ship.
NB Each cruise line has limited space on board the ship for children as the kids club facilities can cater for a limited number of children, and any child booked onto a cruise has access to the kids club. If you are planning on taking a cruise during the school holidays then you need to book early as the children's space will sell out. Also, while most cruise lines have kids club facilities there are some exceptions (not common) so you should check this at time of booking.
Seasickness - What if I get seasick?
The chances are you will not get seasick. On a cruise most people do not suffer from motion sickness. However, if you are going to get seasick then it is likely to happen in the first 24 hours. If you limit the amount of alcohol you consume and activities you do in the first 24 hours you can reduce the chance of this happening. Another thing you can do is select a midship cabin on a lower deck. A cabin in the middle of the ship (midship) will experience the least amount of movement.
There are a number of other precautions/medications you can take, and these can be purchased before you travel at a pharmacy or health shop. Otherwise you can buy them on board.
The best thing you can do if you feel seasick is visit the ship’s doctor. They can give you an injection that will give you relief from your seasickness within 30 minutes. You have planned and saved for your holiday, don't ruin it by feeling sick. Visit the doctor for the injection and get it treated straight away. If you have travel insurance then you can claim this back.
IMPORTANT: A visit to the doctor on board will cost you money so we strongly recommend you get travel insurance before you depart on your holiday.

Frequently Asked Questions
Shore Tours/Excursions - What are they?
Shore excursions are pre-organised tours & sightseeing options that you purchase on board for when your ship is in a port of call. Every ship has a “Shore Ex” desk with qualified staff who can advise you of different excursions available, what’s best to do and generally help you with information on the particular region your ship is visiting.
Shore excursions can be booked on board your ship however some cruise lines allow you to pre-book and pay for excursions online. If there is a tour you really want to do then we recommend you pre-book it as popular tours do sell out.
Shore Tours - Do I need to book one to go ashore?
Shore excursions are not compulsory, you are free to go ashore and return to the ship as many times as you like.
When you go ashore it is important to note:
You must take your cruise I.D. card (ticket) as proof for re-embarking.
The city or town you are visiting may not be close to the port where the ship is docked, cruise lines normally organise shuttle buses (at a minimal charge) throughout the day to and from the city centre.
You must return to the ship at the stipulated time as the ship WILL NOT wait for late passengers.
Shore Tours - How much do they cost?
Tour costs vary depending on the activity, itinerary and inclusions. There is always a wide variety on offer for all age groups and abilities that can start from as little as $25.
Sometimes you can book your tour, when you arrive at your port, direct from the operator at a much cheaper price. However, this comes with a buyer beware warning. The operators used by the cruise line are trusted professionals so you will not be ripped off. Also, if something goes wrong on your tour, the cruise line knows where you are and will take the necessary steps to pick you up if your vehicle has broken down. In extreme cases they will even hold the ship's departure for you if you are late returning from a tour booked through the ship. They will not wait if you go direct through the operator, as they will not know where you are.
Luggage - How much can I take?
Unlike airlines, there are no luggage restrictions on a cruise. However you need to consider that you need to store it in your cabin for your holiday. There is plenty of storage space in your cabin but if you are travelling in a quad cabin you may want to impose your own restrictions.
NB It is important to remember that airlines have different luggage restrictions, so if you are flying either pre or post cruise then you may want to keep within their allowances.
Onboard Currency - Are there cruise dollars?
Cruise lines around the world do not all operate using the same onboard currency. The currency varies from cruise line to cruise line with the most common currency being US dollars. P&O Cruises Australia, Carnival Spirit and the Sun and Dawn Princess all use Australian dollars as their onboard currency.
Onboard Purchases - How do I make them?
Cruising is a cashless society which means when you purchase anything on board you do not pay for it in cash. When you board the ship it is like checking into a hotel, you can either give a credit card imprint or the cruise line will take a cash deposit of approximately $300. You are then given a “cruise card”. Your cruise card is your door key (on most ships), has your dinner table number on it (for traditional dining), and it is used for making any purchases aboard.
When you make a purchase with your cruise card, it is swiped and a receipt is printed that you will need to sign. The cost of the purchase is then added to your onboard account which you settle at the end of your cruise.
Onboard credits - What are they and how do I receive them?
Many cruises on our websites come with onboard credits. This could be from a special promotion that is being run by the cruise line or because of the relationship we have with the cruise lines that allows us to select certain cruises to receive onboard credit. The amount of onboard credit does normally depend on the length of the cruise.
If your reservation receives onboard credit we will confirm this with you in writing and then your onboard account will automatically be in credit for the amount we have confirmed to you. This credit can be used towards any onboard expenditure that is charged back to your cabin. It is important to note that if you do not spend all of your onboard credit it will not be refunded to you in cash so it is best you spend it all while on board.
Tipping/gratuities - Do I need to tip?
Tipping/gratuities are a big issue for a lot of Australasian cruise passengers as it is not our custom to reward good service in this way. What cruise passengers need to consider is that outside of Australasia, the remuneration for personnel in the service industry is quite low. Hence, to keep up a high standard, employees have the incentive of earning additional income via the tips they receive. At the end of the day, how much you tip is up to you.
The most common way cruise lines suggest tipping, is that they add a suggested amount to your daily onboard account. You can choose to keep that on your account or you can ask the purser to remove it. This suggested amount is divided out amongst your cabin steward, your dinner waiter, your assistant waiter, your wine steward, and maitre d’.
Some cruise lines ask passengers to wait until the end of the cruise and they discreetly leave an envelope in your cabin in which to place the appropriate amount. Some cruise lines state that the fare you have paid includes gratuities. Some cruise lines ask that you pre-pay the gratuities with your cruise fare prior to your holiday departure.
Again, the amount you tip is up to you (unless it is prepaid) and it isn't intended to have a negative impact on your holiday. Do what feels most comfortable to you.
Smoking - Can I smoke on a cruise?
The rules surrounding where you can smoke on board a cruise ship vary from cruise line to cruise line. However, none have taken steps to ban smoking completely. Most only allow smoking in designated areas on the open decks. Many have banned smoking on cabin balconies as this poses a fire risk.
Alcohol - Can I bring my own?
Many cruise lines have rules restricting you from taking your own alcohol on board your cruise ship. If you have pre purchased duty free alcohol the ship will take it off you when you board and store it away for you. This alcohol will be delivered to your cabin the night before you disembark. The same applies if you purchase it when you are in port. Any purchases made on board will also be delivered the night before you disembark.
However, Princess Cruises will allow you to bring a bottle of wine aboard which you can drink at dinner or in your cabin.
These restrictions were put in place to create a safer environment on board your cruise ship, where people drink within a controlled drinking environment.

Electrical Safety During and After Storms
In recognition of Electrical Safety Month, May 2012, ECI REC and Electrical Safety Foundation International (ESFI) are glad to provide answers to these frequently asked questions about electrical safety during and after storms. Severe storms and natural disasters can cause a variety of electrical safety hazards in and around our homes. Lightning, downed power lines, and floods are just a few of the serious safety concerns associated with storms. Unfortunately, many of these electrical safety hazards remain long after the storm itself has passed.
To help protect you from storm-related electrical hazards, here are answers to common storm safety questions about:
Lightning
Power Lines
Flooded Areas
Wet Electrical Equipment
Portable Generators
Post-Evacuation Procedures
Lightning
What should I do if I am caught outside during a lightning storm?
Move to a low point. Lightning hits the tallest available object, so get down low in a crouched position if you are in an exposed area.
Stay away from trees.
Avoid metal. Don’t hold onto metal items like bats, golf clubs, fishing rods, tennis rackets, or tools. Stay away from metal sheds, clotheslines, poles, and fences.
Stay away from water, including pools, lakes, puddles, and anything damp—like grass.
Don’t stand close to other people. Spread out.
Is there any sort of warning before lightning strikes?
Not necessarily, but sometimes. If you feel a tingling sensation or your hair stands on end, lightning may be about to strike. Do not lie down. Instead, crouch down, tuck your head, and cover your ears.
What should I do if I encounter a lightning storm while driving in my car?
Slow down and use extra caution. If possible, pull off the road into a safe area.
Am I safer in or out of my car?
Do not leave your vehicle during a thunderstorm. A vehicle is considered safe during a thunderstorm if it is fully enclosed with a metal top such as a hard-topped car, minivan, bus, truck, etc. While inside a safe vehicle do not use electronic devices, such as radio communications.
The storm is still raging outside. Are we safe from lightning if we stay inside the house?
Follow these indoor lightning safety tips to help keep your family safe inside while it’s storming outside:
To avoid lightning strikes, stay away from windows and doors.
If possible, unplug electronic equipment before the storm arrives. Avoid contact with electrical equipment and cords during storms.
Avoid contact with water and plumbing, including sinks, baths, and faucets.
Can I talk on the telephone during an electrical storm?
Use corded telephones only for emergencies. You can use cordless or cellular phones.
I have an outside dog. Is it okay to leave him out there during a lightning storm?
Doghouses are not lightning-safe, and chained animals can easily become victims of lightning strikes. You should bring your pets inside to protect them.
Power Lines
What should I do if I encounter a downed power line?
If you see a downed power line, move at least 10 feet away from the line and anything touching it. The human body is a ready conductor of electricity.
The proper way to move away from the line is to shuffle away with small steps, keeping your feet together and on the ground at all times. This will minimize the potential for a strong electric shock. Electricity wants to move from a high voltage zone to a low voltage zone—and it could do that through your body.
What can I do to help someone who has come in contact with a downed power line?
If you see someone who is in direct or indirect contact with the downed line, do not touch the person. You could become the next victim. Call 911 instead.
Can I use something that is not metal to try to move a downed power line myself?
Do not attempt to move a downed power line or anything in contact with the line by using another object such as a broom or stick. Even non-conductive materials like wood or cloth, if slightly wet, can conduct electricity and then electrocute you.
What should I do if I see a downed power line in the street while I am driving my car?
Do not drive over downed power lines.
What if a power line comes down onto my car or I didn’t see it until I’ve driven into it?
If you are in your car and it is in contact with the downed line, stay in your car. Tell others to stay away from your vehicle.
If you must leave your car because it’s on fire, jump out of the vehicle with both feet together and avoid contact with the live car and the ground at the same time. This way you avoid being the path of electricity from the car to the earth. Shuffle away from the car.
Is a downed power line still dangerous if it has come down in water, like a pool or pond?
Water is a good conductor of electricity. Any amount of water—even a puddle—could become energized. Be careful not to touch water—or anything in contact with the water—near where there is a downed power line.
Flooded Areas
My basement has flooded and there is standing water. Is it safe to go down there?
Use extreme care when stepping into flooded areas. Submerged outlets or electrical cords can energize water, posing a lethal trap.
My washer, dryer, and a few other appliances got really wet during the flood. Can I start using them again after they dry out?
Do not use electrical appliances that have been wet until they have been examined by a qualified service repair dealer. Electrical equipment exposed to water can be extremely dangerous if re-energized without proper reconditioning or replacement.
Does a flood affect my home’s electrical system, too, or just the appliances?
Electrical items, such as circuit breakers, fuses, ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs), receptacles, plugs, and switches, can malfunction when water and silt get inside. Discard them if they have been submerged. Have a licensed, qualified professional replace them.
Does it make a difference if the flood was caused by storm water or by a leaky water pipe?
Ocean water and salt spray can be particularly damaging to electrical equipment due to the corrosive and conductive nature of the salt water residue. Damage to electrical equipment can also result from exposure to flood waters contaminated with chemicals, sewage, oil, and other debris.
No matter what caused the flood, electrical appliances should be examined by a qualified service repair dealer before being re-energized, and electrical items that were submerged should be discarded and replaced by a licensed, qualified professional.
Can flooded outside areas be dangerous too?
Yes—downed power lines or submerged outlets from adjacent homes could energize the water. Use extreme caution when entering any flooded area.
Wet Electrical Equipment
My home wasn’t flooded, but some electrical appliances have gotten wet. Do the same safety rules listed above apply to my situation?
Yes—they still apply. Do not use electrical appliances that have been wet until they have been examined by a qualified service repair dealer. Water can damage the motors in electrical appliances, such as furnaces, freezers, refrigerators, washing machines, and dryers.
Where can I find out more about what should be done with water damaged electrical equipment?
The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) has produced a brochure, Guidelines for Handling Water Damaged Electrical Equipment, for use by suppliers, installers, inspectors,and users of electrical products to provideadvice on the safe handling of electrical equipmentthat has been exposed to water. The NEMA brochure may be downloaded free of charge at: www.nema.org/stds/water-damaged.cfm.
Portable Generators
I bought a new generator so that I’d be prepared for the next power outage. Is there anything special I should know about installing it?
ESFI strongly recommends that a licensed electrician install home generators to ensure they meet all local electrical codes.
Also, make sure your generator is properly grounded in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
Can’t I just plug my generator directly into one of my home’s outlets?
Do not connect generators directly to the household wiring unless an appropriate transfer switch has been installed by a licensed, qualified electrician.
What could happen if I don’t have a transfer switch installed?
Without the proper transfer switch, power provided by the generator can “backfeed” along the power lines, creating a significant electrocution hazard for anyone coming in contact with the lines, including lineworkers making necessary repairs.
I’ve heard that generators should be kept dry. Can I run it in my garage to protect it from the rain?
Never operate a generator inside your home or in any other enclosed—or even partially enclosed—area. Generators very quickly produce carbon monoxide, which can easily enter your home.
Place the generator on a dry surface under an open, canopy-like structure. Do not operate the generator in wet conditions or where there is standing water.
Can’t I just open the garage door to provide ventilation for the carbon monoxide?
Opening windows or doors or using fans does not provide adequate ventilation to prevent the build-up of carbon monoxide. Generators must be located outside a safe distance away from your home’s windows, doors, and vents, through which carbon monoxide can enter your home.
How far away from the house is a safe distance?
Preliminary research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) indicates that even 15 feet from the home is too close to operate a generator safely.
Remember your neighbors, too. Keep your generator a safe distance away from their homes as well.
What exactly is carbon monoxide?
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a poisonous gas that is created when common fuels such as natural gas, oil, wood, or coal burn incompletely. This odorless, colorless, tasteless gas is often called the “silent killer” because it is virtually undetectable without the use of detection technology like a CO alarm. Extremely high levels of carbon monoxide can be fatal within minutes.
How big a problem is carbon monoxide associated with the use of generators?
From 1999-2009, 542 carbon monoxide deaths associated with portable generators were reported to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).
More than 80 percent of carbon monoxide deaths related to portable generators occurred in the home, often resulting from operation of a portable generator within the living space of the home, including the basement, closets, and doorways.
What are the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning?
Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning may include fatigue, shortness of breath, drowsiness, headache, and nausea. Get to fresh air right away if you feel dizzy or weak while running your generator.
Is there anything else I should do to protect my family from carbon monoxide produced by my generator?
Make sure that there is at least one battery-operated or battery-backup carbon monoxide alarm in your home. Test it before using your generator.
Is it safe for my children to play in the area around the generator?
No. Keep children away from portable generators at all times. Also be sure to store generator fuel out of reach of children.
How many appliances can I plug into my generator at one time? Can I use it for my window air conditioner and my refrigerator at the same time?
The capacity of generators varies. Follow the manufacturer’s instruction carefully. Do not overload the generator.
My generator is powering my sump pump, but it is going to need more fuel soon. Can I refuel it while it’s running so I don’t have to turn off the sump pump?
Unplug all appliances from the generator before shutting it down. Turn the generator off and let it cool down before refueling. Refueling the generator while it is running is a significant fire hazard.
Post-Evacuation Procedure
The storm is finally over. Can I go home now?
First and foremost, do NOT return home until instructed by the appropriate local authorities. Once they give the go-ahead:
Return home during daylight hours, especially if power has not been restored.
If you smell gas, leave the premises and notify emergency authorities immediately. Do not turn on lights, light matches, or engage in any activity that could create a spark.
I’ve been told by my local authorities that I can return home now, but could there still be electrical dangers in and around my home?
Yes. Even if you have been authorized to return home, you should still take precautions to protect yourself from electrical hazards posed by downed power lines, flooded areas, and water-damaged appliances and electrical equipment.

New Homes
New Homes
New homes have some very appealing advantages:
Choosing a new home produced by a reputable builder of high-quality properties gives you the peace of mind of knowing that your home doesn't contain asbestos, lead-based paints or formaldehyde. Furthermore, you can rest assured that your new home complies with current federal, state, and local building, fire, safety, and environmental codes.
A properly constructed new home should be cheaper than a used home to operate and maintain. Operating expenses are minimized because a new home should incorporate the latest technology in energy-efficient heating and cooling systems, modern plumbing and electrical service. And with a quality new home, your initial maintenance expenses are practically nonexistent because everything is new.
New homes have enough wall and floor outlets to accommodate all your high-tech goodies. No unsightly, hazardous tangle of extension cords for you.
New homes are only as good as the developers who build them. Visit several of the developer's older projects. Ask homeowners in older developments whether they'd buy another new home from the same developer. See what kinds of problems, if any, they've had with their home over the years. Inquire whether the builder closed the sale on time and honored all contractual commitments, including the completion of any unfinished construction work, on time.
New homes also have some disadvantages:
What you see usually isn't what you get. You see a professionally decorated, exquisitely furnished, beautifully landscaped model home. When touring a model home, ask the salesperson to explain exactly what is and isn't included in the no-frills base price.
Prices are less negotiable. Developers maintain price integrity to protect the value of their unsold inventory of homes and to sustain appraised values for loan purposes. Rather than reduce their asking prices, developers bargain with you by throwing in free extras or giving you upgrades in lieu of a price reduction.
Some developers attract buyers by pricing bare bones houses very close to their actual cost, and then make substantial profits on extras and upgrades. If, upon doing some comparison shopping, you find that these items are outrageously overpriced, buy the bare-bones house and purchase extras from outside suppliers.
New homes are usually more expensive than used ones on a price-per-square-foot basis. Land, labor, and material costs are higher today than they were years ago when the used homes were built. And don't forget that you're buying a home without any wear and tear.
New homes may have hidden operating costs. Developments with extensive amenities usually charge the homeowners dues to cover operating and maintenance expenses of common areas such as swimming pools, tennis courts, exercise facilities, clubhouses, and the like. Some homeowners associations charge each owner the same annual fee. Others prorate dues based on the home's size or purchase price -- the larger or more expensive your home, the higher your dues. If the development has a homeowners association, find out how its dues are structured and what your dues would be.
Sometimes homeowners-association dues are set artificially low to camouflage the true cost of living in the development. When that happens, sooner or later homeowners get slugged with a special assessment to repaint the clubhouse, resurface the tennis court, or whatever. Make sure that the homeowners association you are considering has adequate reserves and that its dues accurately reflect actual operating and maintenance costs.
You may have to use the developer's real estate agent to represent you. Developers always have their own sales staff and their own purchase contracts. Some developers, however, will let you be represented by an outside real estate agent, which is called broker cooperation. Others insist that you use their agent.
If you've fallen in love with a new home but the developer won't cooperate with outside agents, we recommend that you pay for an independent appraisal to get an unbiased opinion of the home's value. It's also wise to have your contract reviewed by a real estate lawyer of your own choosing.
Just because a home is brand new doesn't mean that it's flawless. Moreover, builders work for profit and may be tempted to cut corners to maximize their short-term profits. Even a brand-new home should be thoroughly inspected from foundation to roof by a professional property inspector.

Live radio and a rave review
July 3, 2013 By Madeline Sharples Leave a Comment
I was thrilled to be interviewed by Cyrus Webb yesterday on his live blog talk show, Conversations LIVE! Radio. We discussed mental illness, suicide, and finding meaning in life after unthinkable tragedy. What I took away from that conversation is the importance of having these conversations â€“ openly and truthfully â€“ without pretense. That these are hard subjects is a given. But we must bring them into the light so that others will benefit. If we say the mental illness and suicide words often enough we will have a chance of erasing stigma. Only then will people begin to acknowledge their illnesses and seek help. Only in that way can we save lives. I was also most impressed that Cyrus acknowledged his failed suicide attempt almost at the start of our interview. This shows the extent of the honesty in our discussion. Hereâ€™s the interview. Please listen. As my publisher at Dream of Things, Mike Oâ€™Mary said: â€œCould be the most important 20 minutes you spend today … [Read more...]

Dhoni to lead new look Indian team in Zimbabwe, Rahane deputy to Kohli in Tests
Narada Desk| Updated On: 2016-05-23T16:46:13+05:30 | Location :
Many of the senior members including Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Ajinkya Rahane have been rested for the Zimbabwe tour which will see the likes of Vidarbha opener Faiz Faisal, Punjab batsman Mandeep Singh and Haryana spin duo of Jayant Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal as fresh faces
Star batsman Suresh Raina found himself out of the Indian cricket selectors' radar as he failed to find a place in the team for the limited overs tour to Zimbabwe as well as the Test side against the West Indies next month.
The BCCI senior selection committee retained Mahendra Singh Dhoni as skipper for the new-look India side for the Zimbabwe tour starting from 11 June, while star batsman Virat Kohli will lead the side for the four-match Test series against the West Indies.
Many of the senior members including Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Ajinkya Rahane have been rested for the Zimbabwe tour which will see the likes of Vidarbha opener Faiz Faisal, Punjab batsman Mandeep Singh and Haryana spin duo of Jayant Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal as fresh faces.
The Zimbabwe tour comprises of three One-Day Internationals (ODIs) and as many Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is).
The West Indies-bound Test squad will be led by Kohli while star batsman Ajinkya Rahane will be his deputy. Mumbai pacer Shardul Thakur is the lone new face in the side.
Squads:
Zimbabwe limited overs tour: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain & wk), Lokesh Rahul, Faiz Fazal, Manish Pandey, Karun Nair, Ambati Rayudu, Rishi Dhawan, Axar Patel, Jayant Yadav, Dhawal Kulkarni, Jasprit Bumrah, Barinder Sran, Mandeep Singh, Kedar Jadhav, Jaydev Unadkat, Yuzvendra Chahal

Scientists detect atomic oxygen in Martian atmosphere
Scientists detect atomic oxygen in Martian atmosphere
Narada Desk| Updated On: 2016-05-07T16:46:01+05:30 | Location :
Atomic oxygen is an elemental form of oxygen that does not exist in Earth's atmosphere. It affects how other gases escape Mars and therefore has a significant impact on the planet's atmosphere.
Scientists have detected atomic oxygen in the Martian atmosphere for the first time since the last observation 40 years ago.
Atomic oxygen is an elemental form of oxygen that does not exist in Earth's atmosphere. It affects how other gases escape Mars and therefore has a significant impact on the planet's atmosphere.
An instrument on-board the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) - a joint project of NASA and the German Aerospace Center - helped detect these atoms in the upper layers of the Martian atmosphere known as the mesosphere, NASA said in a statement.
"Atomic oxygen in the Martian atmosphere is notoriously difficult to measure," said SOFIA project scientist Pamela Marcum.
"To observe the far-infrared wavelengths needed to detect atomic oxygen, researchers must be above the majority of Earth’s atmosphere and use highly sensitive instruments, in this case a spectrometer. SOFIA provides both capabilities," Marcum noted.
The scientists could detect only about half the amount of oxygen expected, which may be due to variations in the Martian atmosphere.
The Viking and Mariner missions of the 1970s made the last measurements of atomic oxygen in the Martian atmosphere.
These more recent observations were possible thanks to SOFIA’s airborne location, flying between 37,000-45,000 feet, above most of the infrared-blocking moisture in Earth’s atmosphere, NASA said.
The advanced detectors on one of the observatory’s instruments, the German Receiver for Astronomy at Terahertz Frequencies (GREAT), enabled astronomers to distinguish the oxygen in the Martian atmosphere from oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere.
The findings were presented in a paper published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics.
SOFIA is a Boeing 747SP jetliner modified to carry a 100-inch diameter telescope.

English is the main language of instruction in most classes (Cantonese and Mandarin are retained by a minority of colleges and academic departments). CUHK possesses the largest campus of al higher education institutions in Hong Kong. The hilly 137.3-hectare campus hosts a wide range of facilities, such as excellent libraries, music halls, art museums, a swimming pool, sports fields, tennis courts, squash courts and gymnasiums. A system of minibus routes – operated by the school Transport Unit – runs between the station, academic buildings, and residences. Although the campus is located rather far away from the busier districts of Hong Kong, access to the school is easy through the MTR and the bus system.

Heavy Lifting
Chiropractic Care and Core Training
Core training focuses on the deepest muscular layers of your body, including small muscles such as the multifidi and intertransversarii that lie directly on the spinal column and help move individual spinal vertebras. In order to train these deep muscles properly, the spinal vertebras need to be able to move freely throughout their full range of motion. This is where regular chiropractic care comes in. Chiropractic care identifies, zes, and corrects sites of limited spinal mobility, making it possible for you to optimally train your core muscles.
Returning to fitness requires an ongoing commitment of time and effort. In order to get the most out of your investment in yourself, it’s important to make sure that your body will respond effectively to your exercise activities. Regular chiropractic care helps ensure that you’ll achieve such success.
All of us who’ve experienced a back injury of one sort or another have been told at some point to “avoid heavy lifting.” That type of advice appears to be a no-brainer or at least redundant, as no one whose back is hurting is going to try to pick up an air conditioner or even a 100-foot reel of garden hose. In this context, it’s important to remember the words of Shakespeare’s Cassius: “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves”. The problem isn’t the heavy lifting, as such. The real problem is in us, that is, in our overall level of conditioning or physical fitness.
Most back injuries don’t occur as a result of heavy lifting, but rather are caused by a seemingly innocuous event such as bending over in the shower to retrieve a bar of soap that has fallen to the floor. Other likely pain-producing scenarios are bending over to place a bag of groceries in the trunk of a car bending over to tie a loose shoelace. None of these circumstances involved lifting extraordinary weight. Rather, the common elements are lack of flexibility and lack of appropriate muscle tone and strength to support the weight of your body in a forward flexed position.
The problem isn’t lack of big muscles. Picking up a bar of soap or positioning a 15-pound grocery bag doesn’t require bulging biceps or massive lats. The problem is lack of conditioning. Most of us no longer do actual physical work on a regular basis. We spend the large majority of our day sitting, either working, reading, or watching entertainment on television or other devices. The result of such lack of activity is twofold. Muscles lose strength and muscle fibers are replaced by fat. Additionally, tendons and ligaments contract and become tight, losing their necessary composition of elastic fibers. The functional loss associated with these physiological changes is profound. We experience these change every time we feel a twinge, or worse, in our backs.
The fix is easy and primarily focuses on building up core muscle strength.1,2 Core training is directed toward your deep abdominal muscles. The main such muscle is the transverses abdominis, which surrounds your entire waist, protecting and supporting your lower back. You can think of this critically important structure as your internal weight belt. Activation of the core muscles is required for all effective physical activity.3 Without this essential foundation, any minor attempt at work, even bending over to pick up a pencil, can lead to disaster in the form of excruciating back pain.
Core training includes exercises such as the scorpion, lying windmill with bent legs, pushups, squats, and the plank. Many good books and numerous online videos are available to provide instruction in the performance of core exercises. Your chiropractor is experienced in rehabilitative exercise and will help guide you to the training methods that are best for you.

Kids, Your Eyes Are Like Cameras: Take Pictures, Please

Certainly this is the new age of photography. And I always thought the 70’s were the real photography revolution with your Nikons, Canons, and, of course, Paul Simon’s song, “Kodachrome.” Find it with lyrics at https://youtu.be/N4ltLp30KVs before reading any further.
I remember buying Kodachrome slide film and shooting, sparingly, because processing was expensive. Not so today because you can take hundreds of digital images with smart phones, DSLRs, view them on your computer screen, and share the images with the world. I know I do, all the time. What a difference a revolution makes! And don’t forget those “Selfies” we take ad infinitum…
But in my classrooms I would like to take another approach, a creative, contemplative technique and skill you can teach children from grades 4 on up. This requires an imagination and openness. What I’m offering is something kids would appreciate and understand. They haven’t lost their creativity yet, at least on elementary and middle school levels, despite what Common Core throws at them. And as a veteran classroom teacher I’m always looking for ways to improve and expand kids’ concentration. The upcoming lesson is an experiment to enhance students’ ability to focus, concentrate, contemplate, and to be there while navigating the world around them.
So what is this imaginary concept I would like to teach students? “Your eyes are like cameras that take pictures when open.” Huh? What do I mean? Just what the statement says: Introduce and motivate the idea by saying to the class:
“Imagine your real eyes are like cameras taking pictures of what you see. You record and store those images in your mind. Then, you will use your inner eye to re-view the ‘photographs’ you took on the outside. You go from snapping pictures of what you see in front of you with your real eyes to seeing them again inside your mind with the inner eye. Maybe this sounds a little complicated, so let me take you through the process step-by-step”:
Step 1: “Pretend your eyes are like cameras. Let’s say you’re walking in the street, park, or schoolyard. You see something you really like, whatever it might be, person, place, or object. You think about drawing or writing about what you see once you’re home. But how can you remember the ‘picture’ without having a camera, smart phone, or pad-and-pencil?”
Step 2: “Let’s say you’re walking and you see roses all decked out in their reds, yellows, pinks, and whites in a garden, or humongous cumulus clouds drifting across a brilliant blue sky. What can you do to remember them for a drawing or writing a story? If you had a digital camera you could take pictures of these nature scenes, click, click and click. Then you would re-view your shots on the LCD screen to see the images and load up the memory card on your computer to see them ‘bigger.’”
Step 3: “How can you take photographs without a camera in your hand? But before answering my question, let’s try an experiment: I’m holding the American flag and would like you to stare at it for 30 seconds. When you finish, turn around and look at the back wall of the classroom. Focus on the ‘X’ I drew on the wall for 5 seconds. Now tell me what happened.”
Please note: If all goes well kids will see the flag after focusing on the “X.” I won’t get into the exercise’s details except to say that if children concentrate carefully on “things” they see in the world outside, it will leave an image, impression, or “mind-photo,” a visual aftereffect, of what they have taken with their camera eyes. All these “mind photos” can be used for creative writing, non-fiction writing, as well as art. The resulting visual aftereffects of the flag-on-the-wall help to demonstrate the prior statement. Go to www.colorbasics.com/Optical-Illusions for more information about this recommended activity.
Step 4 (after students have given their hypothetical responses): “Yes, it’s amazing that you see the flag again after first staring at it and then looking at the ‘X.’ This phenomena is called a visual aftereffect (optical illusion). It is what remains in your head after observing things very carefully. You do something similar with your ‘camera eyes’ when you observe things closely, snap your pictures mentally, or in your mind, and create a mind-photo/picture.”
Step 5: “For homework, please take a 15-minute walk in your neighborhood and find things you like, that really stand out and catch your eye, whatever it might be. Then, stop, focus your eye cameras, and take a photo.”
Step 6: “Re-view the images you shot. How? Take another step in ‘the twilight zone’ with me. Use your imaginary inner eye to view the ‘photographs’ you snapped. What are you looking at? Describe the images or mind-photos you see. ZOOM IN on the details. Contemplate, or study, all you see for a moment. Did any feelings, thoughts, ideas, reflections, or experiences come up after contemplating the mind-photos?”
Step 7: “Did the lesson improve your focus, concentration, and ability to observe the world outside and visualize that world on the inside? Check it out when you walk. Take CLOSE-UPS of your IMPRESSIONS and enjoy yourself in the looking, seeing, contemplating, and creating. See flowers, trees, people, animals, birds, or clouds-that-look-like things in a new, exciting, and different way.”
Step 8: “You can even try to place imaginary filters over your camera eyes/lens. Pick a colored filter like red, blue, or yellow filter to light up a scene. Or, try a ‘soft-focus’ filter to ‘blur’ or soften the world and create a certain mood. Use a prism filter to create rainbow fantasy images, colors, and worlds. The choice is yours: go as creative as you would like. Use the inner eye to re-view all ‘photos’ you took as well as the filtered ones.”
Final notes to educators: You’re always trying to find ways to get kids focused and into present time, the NOW. Get students to key in on what’s happening in front of them by pretending their eyes are cameras snapping real-life photographs with the inner eye processing and developing the film, digital images, or mind-photos.
Students learn about outer/inner concentration, contemplation, how to view, re-view, and to visualize the photographs they shoot, as well as the triggered feelings, thoughts, and experiences, all skills and fundamental tools needed in writing, reading, critical thinking, art, creativity, and let’s not forget the real world…

Jeffrey Pflaum @jeffrey_pflaum ( View Google Profile )
Jeffrey Pflaum has been an inner-city elementary school teacher in Bedford-Stuyvesant and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, for thirty-four years (NYCDOE, retired in 2002). He worked as a creative writing, whole language, social studies, gifted/talented, physical education, and mentor teacher in grades K – 6 and special education. Pflaum coached middle school boys and girls basketball teams and one of his players became coach of the Pace University team. Tennis was also taught on the elementary school level to lower grade kids as part of the NY Junior Tennis League Program founded by Arthur Ashe.
Pflaum considers himself a teacher-developer-researcher experimentalist who created successful education projects in emotional intelligence, social and emotional learning, reading, writing, poetry, thinking, creativity, vocabulary expansion, concentration, and intra- and interpersonal communication skills. He has written articles for professional newspapers and publications about his curricula. Various programs appeared on web sites such as ERIC and CASEL/Collaborative for Academic and Social and Emotional Learning (“Experiences, Reflections, and Insights”).
One program was featured at the International National Council of Teachers of English at NYU as one of the best examples of English Language Arts in the NYC Public Schools, K – 12. His students’ poetry and prose have been published in college, writers’, gifted secondary, and children’s literary journals, magazines, newspapers, and by major commercial book publishers; read on public radio (Poetry-In-The-Morning, WNYE-FM, sponsored by the Teachers & Writers Collaborative/NYC); and, won honors and awards from PBS, Channel Thirteen/NYC. One student, Noel “Speedy” Mercado, became a top NYC disc jockey on WKTU-FM.
Pflaum published an inspirational book about adolescent reading lives titled MOTIVATING TEEN AND PRETEEN READERS: HOW TEACHERS AND PARENTS CAN LEAD THE WAY (Rowman & Littlefield Education). For book reviews, go to http://www.examiner.com/review/motivating-your-kids-to-read to see Kecia Burcham's response to the book, and also, The Teachers College Record for Karen Polk's insightful article. For Karen Polk's review (8/24/12), from the Teachers College Record, google "MOTIVATING TEEN AND PRETEEN READERS - Teachers College Record."
Go to www.JeffreyPflaum.com for more articles on "Contemplation Writing," Meditative Writing Ideas, Internet radio interviews, published student poetry, and newspaper articles about his book on motivating adolescent readers and Inner Cities Arts Project.

Thinking Outside the Shoebox
By Josephyn Nakimuli, Washington Department of Corrections
Published: 12/31/2018
The holidays will be a little brighter for some foster children, thanks to some shoe boxes and a group of incarcerated individuals at Washington Corrections Center (WCC) in Shelton.
The group, who call themselves “The Tribal Sons,” donated 60 handmade wooden shoeboxes filled with gifts to Squaxin Island tribal children in foster care. The boxes were presented to Squaxin Island Tribe representatives during a ceremony on December 4, 2018. Each contained gloves, socks, scarves, beaded items, and candy.
Squaxin Tribal Chair Arnold Cooper accepted the boxes on behalf of the tribe. He was visibly overwhelmed looking at the boxes and became emotional speaking about the offering. He held his hands up to each inmate as a sign of gratitude.
“You are not only giving to the community but to the future,” Chairman Cooper said.
Inmates built and hand-painted the boxes with themes ranging from tribal symbols to children’s cartoon characters like Hello Kitty and My Little Pony.
The Tribal Sons are a small group of Native American inmates that focus on the value of tribal brotherhood. Department of Corrections offers many religious, spiritual, and cultural programs to those incarcerated within the prisons. Several prisons have Native American groups that practice cultural traditions such as sweat lodges, powwows, dances and songs and the creation of beaded and painted artwork. Approximately 5.2 percent of the state’s incarcerated population(pdf) are American Indian or Alaska Natives. Squaxin Island, Skokomish, Blackfeet, Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs, Nisqually, Lummi, Tlingit, and Grand Ronde tribes are all represented within the Tribal Sons, according to Yvonne Brumfield, spokeswoman for WCC.
The idea for the boxes came from an incarcerated individual named Jay, a Squaxin Island Tribe member. Jay saw an ad in the Kla-Che-Min, the tribe’s newsletter to which he subscribes. The advertisement requested sponsorship of a foster child for Christmas. After seeing the ad, he decided to do something.
He thought of the boxes that the prison-issued tennis shoes came in. His idea was to paint them and fill them with different gift items. “Anything I could get my hands on to put a smile on the kids’ faces,” he said.
Jay approached his correctional unit supervisor, Stella Jennings, who loved the idea. She then presented the project to Superintendent Dan White and Associate Superintendent Dean Mason, who approved the project.
“I am sure these boxes are going to make a child’s Christmas a little brighter and make them feel that people do care,” Jennings said.
What followed completely transformed the shoebox idea into a six-month long project that Jay described as “a project of love and unity.” When other inmates in the Tribal Circle found out, many of them were eager to participate as well. Soon after, inmates from different units and all racial backgrounds also wanted to help.
Michael Bray, WCC’s construction maintenance project supervisor, advised the team they could use scrap materials to make wooden boxes. From April to October, inmates built and painted the boxes. The incarcerated individuals, who made the boxes, gathered during the ceremony and spoke about what the project meant to them.
“Not only are we giving back, but we are bonding, healing and though it’s in a small way, we are acting as men and giving back to our community,” said inmate Jaydean Ell. He also said a traditional Lummi Nation blessing during the ceremony and performed a song in the Lakota tribal language.
Another inmate, Joshua, said even though they may be from different tribes, “We’re all sons, brothers, fathers, husbands and members of the communities we come from and appreciate this opportunity to give back.”
Incarcerated individual Keith added some of the inmates who made the boxes had been foster kids themselves and this project not only helped them use their time constructively, but they connected on a deeper level to the cause in hopes that they would bring cheer to the kids.
Angel, another member of the Tribal Sons group, shared how this project had helped him keep on track and had been a great opportunity for the Tribal Sons group to work together as a family to “ensure tribal children in foster care are not forgotten.”
Correctional staff also shared some words at the ceremony.
“The boxes are magic and they carry your love, time and prayers,” said Nancy Dufraine, the department’s tribal relations director. “I’m sure the children will feel it.”
Superintendent White and Associate Superintendent Mason praised the staff and inmates for their accomplishments.
“This has become a WCC facility project and I am proud of our staff and incarcerated population who are always looking at how we can better serve the community,” Mason said. "The fact that these beautiful pieces of functional art came from recycled pallet wood only makes the story better.”
No taxpayer dollars were used for the project. Materials and items for the project all came from donations. Incarcerated individuals from the facility's quilting program also knitted hats and scarves to be included in the boxes.
Kathleen Glennon, a classification counselor who is also personally part of a roller derby team, worked with the team to gather hats, gloves and miniature stockings with candy. The Femme Fianna of Dockyard Derby Dames of Tacoma donated these items.
In addition to building the boxes, the Tribal Sons also created and donated dreamcatchers and beaded necklaces.
Krystle Costa, who is part of the prison’s beading program, said, “Tremendous work and passion had gone into the work for this project, and I’m honored to be part of something that will bring so much warmth to foster children this Christmas.”

Omschrijving
Located in the La Balca residential area, facing the 15th fairway of the Tour Course, are eight new single-family homes, divided into two groups of four. Split over two levels with three bedrooms and a basement, these contemporary 280 m2 houses are surrounded by green space and have their own shared swimming pool.
The layout of the homes – V-shaped around the common area - together with the design of the extensive terraces at the rear, ensure privacy for every house, while at the same time offering magnificent views over the golf course, and delivering overall the unique style that’s a hallmark of PGA Catalunya Resort.
All eight units have the same functional components: living/dining room, Bulthaup kitchen, three double bedrooms on the upper floor, one with its own dressing room and bathroom, in addition to another full bathroom on the first floor, and one guest bathroom on the ground floor. Each home comes with 2 private parking spaces and features a 90 m2 basement with natural light and a number of options for conversion depending on owners’ lifestyle preferences: from games room, to gym or wine cellar ... Both the master suite and one of the other bedrooms have their own balcony.
A large planted atrium originating rom basement level lends elegance and personality to the home and is a source of extra ventilation and natural light for all the rooms. On the ground floor, the Bulthaup kitchen and the open-plan living/dining room open out onto a large veranda, complete with barbecue. This terrace blends seamlessly with the landscaped area which bridges the infinity pool and communal area, while always keeping in view the background of the golf course

CBI Special Director Rakesh Asthana who was sent on leave by government till November 1(Photo | Twitter)
By PTI
The CBI on Thursday told the Delhi High Court that the FIR on bribery allegations against Special Director Rakesh Asthana and others shows cognisable offences.
The agency opposed Asthana's plea seeking quashing of the FIR and said a roving inquiry at this stage was not permissible.
It also told the court that the probe against Asthana was at a nascent stage and several incriminating documents, as well as the role of other persons, was under investigation.
The agency said it was handicapped in the probe as certain files and documents were under the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) scrutiny.
The agency denied all adverse allegations levelled by Asthana, "whether germane or not germane", in his petition.
The petitions of Asthana, CBI DSP Devendra Kumar and alleged middleman Manoj Prasad are scheduled to come up for hearing before a bench of Justice Najmi Waziri during the day.

South Florida Firm Sells 240-unit Southwinds Point Apartments in Metro Atlanta for $28.35 million
After a three-and-a-half-year hold PointOne Holdings generates a return multiple of 2.5 times the total equity invested
ATLANTA (PRWEB) FEBRUARY 06, 2019
PointOne Holdings announced the sale of Southwinds Point Apartments, a 240-unit garden-style multifamily apartment community located in Metro Atlanta’s city of Stockbridge. The property sold on January 10th, 2019, generating a return multiple of 2.5 times the total equity invested in a period of three and a half years.
During the period in which PointOne Holdings owned and operated the property, occupancy increased from 92 to 99 percent and average effective rents increased by 37 percent. PointOne Holdings drove the property’s quarterly net operating income from $302,000 to $421,000, a 40 percent increase. Southwinds Point was successfully managed by Pegasus Residential.
“Our initial strategy to spend $1.25 million on a major capital improvement campaign had a substantial impact on the net operating income growth at the property” said Ben Colonomos, PointOne Holdings’ Managing Partner. “The keystone project at the property was to convert the tennis courts into a spectacular amenity area for our residents, featuring a large green space which included outdoor kitchens, grilling stations, a central fireplace, walking paths, a gazebo with picnic tables and all new outdoor furniture.”
“PointOne Holdings targeted execution strategy, our driven focus to improve the community, as well as our attention to detail at Southwinds Point resulted in outsized investor returns in a very short period of time” said Leo Peicher, PointOne Holdings’ Managing Partner.”
Southwinds Point was successfully marketed and sold by David Gutting of JLL. “What made this transaction a tremendous success for both buyer and seller was PointOne Holding’s success in establishing a well-proven value-add strategy that the buyer could easily expand upon” said David Gutting. “That strategy, coupled with Point One’s strategic onsite amenity improvements, paved the path for the property to remain competitive in this dynamic logistics corridor.”
PointOne Holdings is a real estate investment firm headquartered in South Florida and Atlanta with properties located throughout the Southeastern United States and Texas. The firm owns and manages a diversified portfolio of residential and commercial assets valued in excess of $730 million. PointOne Holdings’ core principles are founded on precise investment selection, thorough due diligence, creative deal structuring, strong financial management and proactive and responsive communication. PointOne Holdings’ principals are seasoned professionals with over 40 years of combined experience who have collectively conducted over $1.9 billion in real estate transactions.

The conference Room
We also have a conference room for small groups/private functions with the capacity of about 50-60 people. The rates of the conference room are 300,000/= without sound and 400,000/= with sound regardless of any day of the week.
What We Do
Sharing Youth Centre is a diocesan youth project and not a parish. The statement sounds simple, but does create a strange situation.
Many youth do not come to the Centre for anything other than their studies or their sport or leisure.

Pastoral Department
Sharing youth Centre organizes a whole range of pastoral activities to suit the need of the youth and of parents.
Youth Mass in the hall every Sunday at 10.30am

Church Shopping and Other Such Neccessities
It's been awhile since I have give you an update on what is going on with us, so, let me catch you up to date....
Ian and I are still living outside of Nashville with my parents.
Ian is still looking for a job.
He has a BS and a Masters in International Business.
Ian has completed over 400 applications.
Ian has gotten one interview, and it was a bust.
We are still waffling over what to do next. Alright, truthfully, Ian is still waffling over what to do next. I've already decided that we can handle living here for the next 5-6 months (September-February,) until we head for training in March ish for our overseas job.
Ian isn't so sure. But you know how that is. You can handle your own parents, but learning the intricacies of your in-laws is just tiring.
Right. So I am pretty sure we will just stay here and substitute teach. Both of us, that is. We don't have that much in the way of monthly bills, and we will be able to pay off some credit card debt that has accrued due to our 3 moves in 3 months without any job. We'd love to be able to save up some money, and, honestly, to finally have some money to spend!
{Ian's tennis shoes are seriously 4 years old and are ridiculously unattractive. Those will be the first things to be replaced, I promise!}
I have a whole list in my head of things that should be replaced or just acquired. And, since all of our winter things are locked away in our storage unit in FL and are unaccessible, we will have to purchase coats, sweaters, pants, and... closed toe shoes. (what are those again?)
Along with our {hesitant} decision to just stay here, comes the need to find a new church. Our church home will always be back in Oviedo, where we grew up and were married. Our church membership will stay at our church in Gainesville, where there is excellent leadership and a desire to stay connected while we begin our new jobs as M's.
But, we know how important it is to be actively involved with a church, and to have healthy fellowship, so we began our search today.
Bleh.
I hate walking into a new church. No matter how friendly it is, I always feel like everyone is staring.
Moving on...
So the church we tried today was pretty good! It reminded me of my home church at FBCO 12 years ago. Not too big or small. Plenty of ways to get involved, and a nice mix in worship. Ian loved the preaching but I am not sure if he wants to just settle quite yet. We might try out a few new places, but this was the only one in the area that really interested us, so we'll have to do some research.
That's all for now. I hope everyone has had a wonderful weekend and are well rested for the start of a new work week!

I sure can sympathize with your church shopping feelings! It was NOT a fun process for my family when we were doing it, and it wasn't a great process when Andrew and I were looking, either. Hope that you find a great place soon!!

That's great that you liked that church - I understand wanting to look at a few other church's too, but it's good that you liked the first one!

Good luck in the church search! Substitute teaching is a good way to earn cash, which is pretty flexible. I think that's a great idea for you guys right now :-)

"Mon nom est Legion, car nous sommes nombreux"...
Que l’on ait découvert cela depuis tout petit, ou que l’on soit tombé dessus sur le tard, on est souvent devenu des passionnés de jeux vidéo. Nous sommes de plus en plus nombreux à cultiver cette addiction !
Bienvenue chez XboxLegion !
Vous pourrez trouver sur ce blog personnel, essentiellement, des news, des compte-rendus d'évènements (tels des fan-day, des salons), mais aussi des tests de jeux vidéo pour les consoles de salon (Xbox One, Xbox360, PS4 et PS3) et les consoles portables (PS Vita). Accessoirement, cela parlera parfois aussi de cinéma, de Blu-ray, de télévision, de bouquins (BD, livre photo, romans) et de tout ce qui pourrait me plaire.
Votre participation, vos commentaires seront les bienvenus.
Nous étions des joueurs anonymes, nous sommes désormais Légion :)

Frosted Flakes, Fruity Pebbles, Cocoa Puffs, Fruit Loops, and Lucky Charms these cereals have been disappearing off shelves near you, and one man is to blame. Ever since day one, of Mr. Ramirez working here at Antelope Valley High School, it’s been rumored that he is a …Cereal Killer. Yes, you read it right, one of our teachers is a Cereal Killer, it is a scary and terrifying truth.
Mr. Ramirez started here in the fall of 2016, and the suspicion started a month later. After two months it got to a point where his students would stop bringing their cereal to class after snack out of pure fear. The cafeteria is on a serious hunt for all their missing cereals, and this hunt with no lead is making it maddening for every cereal lover.

A very warm welcome to Olsson Fire & Risk UK to Cambridge House
21st March 2018 Charlotte MorrisonNo CommentsBlog
What Olsson do as a business
Olsson Fire & Risk Consulting are a specialist fire safety engineering company, founded in 2016. We provide a wide range of fire safety advice to our clients, including new building designs, refurbishments and fire risk assessment and safety management advice for existing buildings. We have 25 staff, with offices in Manchester, London, Oxford, Edinburgh, Glasgow and of course Bath. Clients include Google, the All England Lawn Tennis Club, the RFU at Twickenham, Laing O’Rourke and many others.
What made you choose Bath as your next UK location
We have offices where our staff want to work, being independent gives us this flexibility. Andy Passingham was based in Bath, where he was previously leading the fire engineering team for Buro Happold consulting engineers before joining OFR in 2017 to found the Bath office, serving the South West and linking closely with our London team.
Why did you decide to move to Cambridge House?
We previously had desks in a shared space in a converted shop, which was fine for starting up, but did not have room for expansion…and the WIFI wasn’t great! When Cambridge House opened we took a larger space to allow our longer-term plans for expansion to be realised. It also allows us to host clients in a more professional environment, with excellent meeting facilities. It is also very well located close to the train station which is important for us.

The Life of a Human Cow (For God)
The Beautiful fur covers the body. Soft. Fluffy. White. You are the enemy of many chickens.
The nearby human places your head onto your body. ZIP! ZIP! The fur is on. You are not a naked creature! The pajamas are placed onto your furry body.
“Out to the corner.” A mysterious voice demands.
The world can only be half-seen. Light floods in as the back door is open. Sidewalk Sidewalk. WALK WALK (cow hoof on the ground, cow hoof on the ground)
The temperature is warm. STEP STEP STEP. You stop at your destination. You are a Bovine Prostitute.
“Dancing Time.”
A homeless man laying on the street turns his head. He sees a large cow dancing around on the street corner. Cars are driving by honking. “Anything for a dollar.” Homeless Jim slurs his words.
The human creature within the Bovine costume slowly tires. DANCE DANCE DANCE. The cars continue their honks.
Sweat drips down into the eyes of the human. The eyes can not be touched through the blocking apparatus of the COW head.
The sweaty cow-human walks back to home base.
ZIP ZIP. The Head is removed. It is a human man. Into the freezer for you. ENJOY that cold pepsi.
(This establishment is closed on Sundays)
This sweaty cow-man brings joy to small kids and slight terror to confused dogs.
Praise the Lord! Jesus loves chicken sandwiches.
“Hey Cow! Out to the corner!”
My pleasure.
-DJ ROBO BISCUIT (a man who used to be a COW)

LFC Legend surprises families at Open Goals in Stanley Park
Liverpool FC Legend, Robbie Fowler, surprised families at the launch of the LFC Foundation's ‘Open Goals’ activity programme in Stanley Park.
As a prank, Robbie was introduced as the new LFC Foundation Coach who would be helping with the session, much to the surprise and confusion of the families taking part.
Once over the initial shock, the families joined Robbie in games of rounders, mini-tennis, and relay races, and both kids and their parents enjoyed asking him questions about his career and having their photograph taken with him.
Open Goals is a programme of free sports and physical activity sessions that take place every weekend in public parks across the Liverpool City Region, run by coaches from the LFC Foundation. Each session includes a variety of family-friendly games and activities like Quick Cricket, Ultimate Frisbee, Orienteering Games, Hot Potato, Cat and Mouse, Bean Bag Throw and Frisbee Golf.
Jean Twine, who brought her four sons to the park to enjoy the Open Goals session, said: “My kids loved taking part in the Open Goals session today; they’re a great excuse to get my kids away from the TV, and outside in the fresh air having fun together as a family, and socialising with other kids. We’ll definitely be coming back.”
“Having Robbie come along today was a brilliant surprise, my kids can’t wait to tell their friends that they were coached by the famous Robbie Fowler.”
Open Goals sessions take place in local parks around Liverpool each weekend, including; Stanley Park, Doric Park, Wavertree Sports Park, Walton Hall Park, Belle Vale Park, Norris Green Park and Jubilee Sports Bank. The LFC Foundation has also scheduled several additional sessions during the summer, to keep families active during the school holidays.
Open Goals sessions are open and inclusive to all abilities and skill levels and focus on family-friendly activities, not just football.
The LFC Foundation’s Open Goals project is funded by the Premier League and PFA Community Fund, which supports Premier League club community schemes in creating positive social change within their local communities.
Liverpool John Moores University is supporting the Open Goals programme, by providing funding to support the training and management of the volunteer programme for LJMU students and staff.

Why Hire Waste Removal Companies
You could wonder, "Exactly why is it that no real matter what I do, rats enter my house?" Do not worry. You're perhaps not alone. Lots of people wonder about this really fact.
The reason why rodents may enter, despite your best initiatives to help keep them out, is that their small figures are really flexible. Furthermore, their sensitive whiskers act as devices, telling them where and how they could press through the cracks. Meaning, regrettably, that rodents may fit through openings and chips which can be significantly smaller compared to measurements of their bodies.
Mice Also Chew Openings to Produce Them Greater
When a mouse gets into your house, she or he usually gnaws the gap to create it bigger, making it simpler to escape easily in case a predator-or you-comes following them. They can gnaw through drywall, wood, and an array of other ingredients to permit themselves and every mouse in their family in to your commercial exterminators And chances are they multiply.
More Rodents, more Problems
One mouse may possibly not be much of a problem, with the exception of the mouse droppings that you have to wash every day. But once a pregnant mouse takes house at home, you are set for a ton of trouble. To feed her family, the mouse will scavenge during your food supplies, making scat and urine in her wake. Whenever we say family, we mean up to 14 babies-in a gestation time that only lasts for no more than 30 days.
Additionally, rats carry fleas. These fleas can hop from the mouse to your pets. Those fleas also take conditions, some as critical since the Bubonic Plague. Ticks mouthful the rodents, and then jump aboard you or your pets. An individual will be injured, bacteria enter your bloodstream, creating you susceptible to significant, also lethal illnesses.
Hantavirus, which in turn causes severe respiratory issues, is also one of many more serious ailments which is why rodents serve as vectors. This infection is especially worrisome since it is an airborne virus. That puts persons at risk for breathing the disease as they cleanup the wreck the mice make.
Rural people are a lot more at risk for hantavirus, because the type of mouse where it the disease is generally discovered may be the deer mouse, which lives in sheds and barns, in addition to in properties positioned in rural, forested areas. Finding medical help easily, needed for remaining hantavirus, is harder for people who reside in distant areas. If you reside in the united states and experience respiratory symptoms after cleaning the barn or cleaning mouse scat in your house, don't wait. Find medical support immediately.
The bottom point is: you'll need to rid your house of these pests. They are not Mickey Mouse or Mighty Mouse. They're Chance Mouse.
Getting Rodents out of Your Home
While common culture has produced rodents search benign, as you can see, they are anything but. Outside, wherever their citizenry could be controlled by nature's food sequence, they are little problem. Once they come inside, but, you'll need to get action.
First, contact a pest elimination support near you. Inquire further to suggest you on the most effective removal strategy that will support eliminate your property of those pests. They could also have the ability to recommend you on switch, humane methods that could get rodents out of your home and straight back external where they belong.

Multi-use Mini-splits from Lennox Industries
From man caves to family rooms – mini-splits have many uses in the home.
No ductwork needed. Their ductless design makes mini-splits ideal for older homes with ductwork that needs repairs to be usable, new additions where cost is a factor, and spaces like sunrooms with no space for ductwork.
A quick fix for hot spots in the home. A mini-split can fix chronically hot or cold spot in a home that has a ducted HVAC system. “If you talk to somebody who’s got a decent-sized house, they’ve probably got an area you could put a mini-split in,” Cross says. For example, homeowners who enjoy working in the garage, but don’t like the sweltering summer heat or freezing winter cold, can add a mini-split for better comfort.
Creative options for custom control. “Thanks to multi-zone heat pumps,” Cross Says, “mini-splits can be used in all sorts of multiple configurations. Maybe you have a ‘man cave’ you want to keep at 68° and a TV room you want to keep a little warmer. You can figure out how many different zones you want to heat or cool, decide which indoor units you need, and then match them op with an outdoor unit that corresponds to the single or multiple zones you’re implementing in your house.

Two years after a crash that left him in a coma, the BMX icon ties the knot in Las Vegas
By
Mark Gray
November 03, 2012 02:30 PM
Talk about a happily ever after!
Two years after a horrific crash that left him in a coma, BMX icon TJ Lavin is a married man.
The host of MTV’s The Challenge wed longtime fiancée Roxanne Siordia, 32, Friday night in Las Vegas. The nuptials at City Hall came eight years to the day that the duo met.
“We always knew we wanted to get married on Nov. 2 because that’s when we met,” Lavin, 35, told PEOPLE. “I knew I was gonna marry her the second I met her. We thought about doing it at the drive-thru but we couldn’t go through with it, so I said I was down for City Hall. Fancy weddings aren’t our thing.”
The couple had been talking about marriage as long as 6 years ago, but life got in the way after Lavin’s accident left him comatose for 9 days. He now says he’s 100 percent recovered.
“My coma … really messed up things. If you go in a coma it really messes with your social life, so don’t do it,” he said, joking. “But when I got [through] my wreck … it opened my eyes, and we had to work on our relationship more and make It more of a priority. We had to find ourselves – [then] everything was cool.”
The wedding – in which Lavin donned a suit and Siordia wore a tail dress – had been planned for a few weeks. Next up: thinking about the honeymoon.
“I told Roxanne we can go anywhere in the world she wants to go and do anything she wants to do,” he said. “So, she’s got some decision making to do.”
Siordia has a daughter, Raquel, 13, from a previous relationship. Lavin plans to formally adopt her.

CURRENT MUSEUM EXHIBITS
Artists // Animals - Six Artists Look at Animals
ix artists will present a wide range of interpretations of the animals that co-exist with us on our planet, inspire our imagination and sense of fantasy, and inhabit our dreams and subconscious. These varied points of view will be on exhibit at the Jefferson Museum of Art & History from Thursday, August 30 (Member Preview) through February 17, 2019.
The animal images that are presented range from realistic to child-like, oddly humorous to whimsically disturbing. The wide range of styles and viewpoints is not surprising considering the differing backgrounds, experience, and education of the artists.
Michael Felber creates detailed, realistic, portraits of animals as seen with a naturalist’s eye. His paintings reveal an awareness of anatomy and how the muscles move. However, these aren’t zoological specimens, but creatures filled with life and personality.
Felber received an MFA in printmaking from the San Francisco Art Institute. He taught printmaking at the University of California at Santa Cruz and the San Francisco Museum of Art. Feber also worked as an animator in films and television followed by working as an illustrator. Currently, he’s drawing and painting grizzly bears.
Felber has exhibited in many museums including the Smithsonian Institution, the Denver Museum of Natural History, and the South Australian Museum. He lives outside of Port Townsend in the woods by water with his wife, painter Karen Hackenberg.
Jason Gould also lives in Port Townsend and is a fourth generation local. Gould is self-taught and credits his three children with helping him select the subject matter for his paintings. When they were younger, he’d use their perceptions of the world as inspiration for the world that is comes to life in his paintings. His colorful paintings often feature a recognizable building or block of Port Townsend.
Gould has a lifelong interest in the arts and all types of creation and creative play.
“I continue to find inspiration in the light and spirit of everything and hope that the joy of the process is transferred to the viewer,” said Gould.
Jody Joldersma’s whimsical yet slightly disturbing visual narratives are inspired by the experience of growing up caught between a collapsing conservative steel town and the rural escapism of her grandparent’s farm in the coal mountains of central PA. Her work focuses on the interplay of gender, nature, culture, and the boundaries we place on them.
Joldersma has a BFA from the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York. She is a co-founder of Feminist Camp Seattle and a National Artist at A.I.R. Gallery.
Max Grover’s fun and colorful landscapes, people, animals, and interesting items from his collections, are familiar sights in the Port Townsend area. He’s shown in his own gallery and others in Port Townsend as well as in throughout the Northwest and California including a solo exhibit at the Bainbridge Island Museum of Art.
Grover was one of the founders of Port Townsend School of the Arts where he continues to teach. He’s created many popular children’s books.
Frank Renlie’s paintings are inhabited by delightfully endearing yet rather odd characters and creatures. Painting his purely imaginary world is a second career for Renlie after spending 45 years as a freelance illustrator. His work appeared in magazines throughout the U.S., France, and Germany.
Renlie graduated from the Bumely School of Professional Art (now the Art Institute of Seattle) in 1963 while he was working at Boeing as a graphic designer. He was inspired by his teachers William Cummings and James Edward Peck. He considers his painting self-taught.
His paintings have been exhibited in juried shows throughout the Northwest including the Seattle Art Museum’s Northwest Annual. He’s also exhibited in California, and Pennsylvanian and internationally in Mexico, Israel, and England.
Drew Elicker is a long time Port Townsend artist who arrived here in the somewhat infamous 70s and was active with the artists and arts that would establish Port Townsend’s reputation as an art town. He worked part time at the Leader as a graphic artist and spent the rest of the time creating his own art.
A Northwest native who grew up on Bainbridge Island, iconic images of the Northwest feature proximately in his work. Like reassembled, brightly colored puzzle pieces they playfully express delight with a sense of place. Elicker studied both commercial and fine art at Cornish School of the Arts, Evergreen State College, and the Pratt Institute in New York. While at Cornish, Elicker was influenced by his teacher, Northwest artist Charles Stokes.
The Jefferson Museum of Art & History is located at 540 Water Street, Port Townsend, and is open from 11:00 to 4:00 every day except Tuesday. Entrance fees are $6 for adults and $5 for seniors. The Museum will be open for Art Walk on Saturday, September 1st. Admission is free that day. For more information the museum may be reached at 360-385-1003.
Location Jefferson Museum of Art & History, 540 Water Street, Port Townsend, WA, 98368

‘OFFICER JOHN’ PROVES A HIT IN GLASGOW GAY BAR
Jordan Hirst 3 years ago 60 Views
We can only sing the praises of “Officer John”, a Glasgow cop called to deal with an incident in one of Scotland’s busiest gay bars.
Officer John and his colleagues were called to the bar following a fight.

Once the problem was sorted, patrons were stunned when Officer John took to the stage and belted out Gloria Gaynor’s gay anthem I Will Survive.
The disturbance was quickly forgotten as revellers danced along to his not-so-dulcet tones.
Great work Officer John!

#STINGDAILY: Home Cookin'
Oct. 18, 2012
By Jon Cooper
Sting Daily
There’s no place like home.
There’s no place like home.
It’s become something of a mantra for Georgia Tech volleyball thus far this season.
It’ll be something they’ll be counting on this weekend when Florida State and Miami, the top two teams in the ACC and the Nos. 12 and 24 teams nationally come to town — FSU is in tonight beginning at 8:30 p.m., Miami is a 1 p.m. Sunday start.
The Jackets are 9-0 thus far at O’Keefe Gym — two wins away from matching their best home start in the Tonya Johnson Era (they started 11-0 in 2009) — and will be counting on every bit of that home court advantage in trying to set the Sunshine State teams.
Redshirt senior outside hitter Bailey Hunter said the team is very much aware of the streak and will use it as incentive.
“Being at home and keeping that winning streak alive and not dropping one at home is really important,” said Hunter, who enters the weekend second on the team in kills (253) and digs (164).
“We really just have to play free,” she added. “With the games we’ve lost this season it’s been all on us and it’s all stuff that we can control. We have to make sure that we control the controllables throughout the game and that everyone takes care of their responsibilities. It’s going to take all 15 girls to win both matches. We have to have every single person on all cylinders, prepared at all times to come in and take care of their responsibilities and get the job done.”
The Jackets enter the weekend with a 6-3 conference record, tied for fourth in the ACC with North Carolina and one game behind third-place NC State, both of whom beat Tech on their home floors three weeks ago — they come to O’Keefe in three weeks. Tech also is only two games behind the Seminoles and Hurricanes. That makes this weekend a big one as far as positioning.
Tech will be riding an emotional high and expects a carryover from its four-set win Tuesday night in Athens.
“It was nice to beat them in front of such a big crowd,” said Hunter, who assured herself a perfect 5-0 career mark against UGA. “Plus we played really composed and that was good for us and will give us a lot of momentum for [tonight’s] game and for Sunday’s game.”
While being successful on the court is huge in ACC volleyball circles, there is something bigger to be taken into account when the Jackets meet the Seminoles.
Tonight is Tech’s annual Dig For The Cure, a night dedicated to breast cancer awareness. Fans can participate in raffles and buy special pink T-shirts. The team’s game-worn pink jerseys also will be auctioned off on RamblinWreck.com with bidding beginning at noon Saturday and lasting through noon on Nov. 3 (each jersey begins at $75). All the proceeds from Friday and the auction will benefit the Susan G. Komen Foundation.
“Dig Pink is always a really big game for us,” said Hunter. “We pack out all of our games but to pack that one out and promote breast cancer awareness is really important to our team because there are a lot of team members that have been affected by it. It’s really near and dear to our hearts. There’s a lot of money and a lot of opportunity to make money for the cause, so it’s important.”
“I love dig for the cure because it gives me a chance to contribute to a cause that is so much bigger than winning a game but helping a cause that can save!” said senior libero Nicki Meyer, the team’s leader in digs with 241 digs (3.35 per set, just out of the league’s top 10). “It gives us a chance to take a step back and see the big picture and fight for something as a team like the millions of people affected by breast cancer.”
Not necessarily as important as Dig For The Cure but important, nonetheless, is ACC Sportsmanship Week, which also will be part of the weekend.
“It’s more promoting the sportsmanship aspect, everyone knowing that it’s a focus for us and to keep that in mind for them,” said Hunter. “Before each game the commentators do a really nice job of talking about sportsmanship so to have an actual weekend focused on that is really good and probably beneficial for players and fans together.”
Hunter wanted to make clear that being good sports shouldn’t preclude the O’Keefe crowd from being its usual deafening.
“I think our fans have kind of mastered that fine line because you can definitely teeter and can get onto a player and say some things that are kind of hurtful,” she said. “The only thing that I would say that they do, is when the other team is serving and they’re bouncing the ball and they’re making that noise that they always make. But it’s never anything specifically targeting a person or the team, which is very respectful. They give just enough to keep us motivated and generate energy.”

Three Tech Golfers Win Local U.S. Open Qualifiers
May 22, 2007
ATLANTA – Georgia Tech sophomore Cameron Tringale became the third current or future Yellow Jackets’ player to win a U.S. Open local qualifying tournament Monday when he shot a 66 and earned co-medalist honors at the Flat Creek Club in Peachtree City, Ga.
Tringale joins Tech sophomore Adam Cohan of Wayne, Pa., who won a local qualifying event May 11 at Philmont Country Club in Huntington Valley, Pa., and incoming freshman William Miller of Venetia, Pa., who won the local qualifying tournament May 17 at Quicksilver Golf Club in Midway, Pa.
They advance to one of 13 sectional qualifying tournaments played on June 4 along with Tech senior Roberto Castro of Alpharetta, Ga., who qualified May 9 at the Old Overton Club in Birmingham, Ala., and 2002 All-American alumnus Matt Weibring of Plano, Texas, who advanced from the Richardson, Texas qualifier on May 14 at Sherrill Park Golf Club.
Exempt from local qualifying are alumni David Duval (a former British Open champion); Tripp Isenhour, Matt Kuchar and Bryce Molder (top 20 earnings list on the Nationwide Tour from 2006), Troy Matteson (PGA Tour winner and top 125 earnings list from 2006) and Nicholas Thompson (Nationwide Tour winner). Kuchar and Matteson also are exempt from local qualifying by virtue of their standing in the current top 100 of the 2007 PGA Tour earnings list.
Stewart Cink, a three-time All-American now playing on the PGA Tour, is exempt into the U.S. Open field as a result of his position on the final top 30 tour earnings list from 2006.
The 107th U.S. Open Championship will be held at Oakmont Country Club in Oakmont, Pa., June 14-17. Entries were open to any professional and to amateurs with USGA Handicap Indexes not exceeding 1.4. The U.S. Open is one of 13 national championships conducted annually by the United States Golf Association.

Perfecting Your Tennis Serve Grip Technique
06 Sep 2016/6 Comments

Today we’re going to talk about the tennis serve grip. It’s one of the very first things you’ll need to learn if you want to hit a proper tennis serve and it’s something you can practice before you even step onto a court. In this article, we’ll cover:
The best grip for your tennis serve
Tennis serve grip technique
Tips for your serve grip
The serve grips used by top players
Once you feel comfortable with your grip you should check out our article on forming the correct serve stance.
The Best Grip for Your Tennis Serve
If you’re new to tennis you might be surprised to learn that there is a specialized grip for the tennis serve. It’s called the continental grip, but before we get into the details let’s start by talking about why this is the best grip for your serve and the benefits of learning to use it.There are four main benefits for learning the continental grip:
There are four main benefits for learning the continental grip:
Variety: one of the main reasons you’ll want to use the continental grip for your serve is because it allows you to hit various types of serves with ease. With the continental grip, you can hit a big flat serve, a slice serve, a topspin serve or kick serve all with a single grip. Learning to hit each of these serves will allow you to be more aggressive and keep your opponent guessing, while also enabling you to hit a consistent and reliable second serve.
Power: if you’re serious about your serve then you’re going to want to learn the trophy pose, which will set you up for achieving maximum power and the fastest serve. However, in order to get the most out of the trophy pose you need a grip that complements your service motion and the continental grip is exactly the grip for the job.
Control: one of the keys to the continental grip is that it allows you to generate topspin on your serve. It’s topspin that provides you with the necessary control to hit aggressively while keeping the ball in the court.
Flex: last but not least, the continental grip positions the face of the racquet so that your wrist can more easily flex throughout the service motion. As you learn how to serve or spend time refining your current serve, you’ll find that this flex helps enable a fluid motion with your serve while also allowing you to snap your wrist to achieve topspin.
If you’re like most beginners you may have started with some version of a forehand grip, which positions the face of the racquet and your strings towards the net when you hold it out in front of you as shown in the following picture. To be clear, this grip is incorrect for your serve.
However, the truth is, without an understanding of the proper technique and mechanics necessary to hit an effective tennis serve this grip is pretty logical.
The ball needs to travel forward, so you position the face of your racquet forward too. This way when you hit the tennis ball it moves towards the net and into the service box.
The challenge is that a forehand grip severely limits your ability to progress your serve and get better over time because you cannot achieve the benefits mentioned above.
Recognizing this, let’s jump into the proper technique for holding your continental tennis serve grip.Tennis Serve Grip Technique
Tennis Serve Grip Technique
The technique for your tennis serve grip really boils down to how you need to hold your tennis racquet to form the continental grip. There are a few different ways you can approach forming the continental grip – let’s take a look at each.
Shake Hands With Your Racquet
One of the easiest ways to learn how to form the continental grip is to hold the racquet out in front of you and simply reach out and shake hands with the tennis racquet.
To do this, hold your tennis racquet out in front of you with the edge of the racquet frame pointed down towards the court, i.e. perpendicular to the ground, and the strings facing to the side. When you go to shake hands with the racquet your grip should be very close to holding a continental grip.
Here’s a video that shows you how to “shake hands with your racquet.”
This easy method is great for beginners and kids as it helps provide them with a simple reference to remember the grip. After showing a group of kids how to hold this grip you can usually just shout out “shake hands with your racquet” and they’ll all be able to easily find the grip.
Hold Your Racquet Like a Hammer
Another reference often used is to hold your racquet like a hammer as if you were going to use the side of the racquet to hammer in a nail.
Similar to the shake hands with your racquet, this simple method should provide you with an easy to remember technique to hold your continental serve grip.
Find The Right Bevel
The most exact way to find your tennis serve grip is to use the bevels of the handle, which you may not have even noticed were there.
If you take a look at the handle of your tennis racquet you’ll notice it is an octagon with eight sides or bevels, just like a stop sign.
To find the correct grip we can simply label or number each bevel of your handle. With the racquet out in front of you and the side of the racquet frame pointing down towards the court we’ll label the very top bevel as #1 and then each subsequent bevel moving counterclockwise all the way around to #8.
If you’re right handed you’ll want to open your hand and place the inside of your index fingers knuckle against the #2 bevel or the #8 bevel if you’re left handed and then grip the racquet.
Here’s another video to show you exactly what I mean.
Once you do this you should be holding a continental grip.
Tips for Your Tennis Serve Grip
When you first begin to use a continental grip for your serve it’s likely going to feel a bit awkward and will take some time to get used to. To help, here are some of our favorite tips for your serve grip.
When you first begin to use a continental grip for your serve it’s likely going to feel a bit awkward and will take some time to get used to. To help, here are some of our favorite tips for your serve grip.
Relax Your Hand
Often times when serving, players will tightly grip their racquet handle. This may be because they’re worried the racquet is going to fall out of their hand when they serve or perhaps that a firm grip will allow them to hit harder.
However, when it comes to tennis, tension is a player’s worst enemy because it prevents your body from remaining fluid and flexible, which is where much of your power and control comes from.
So, rather than tightly holding your serve grip or squeezing your racquet handle too hard, simply relax your hand so the racquet handle is secure yet loose enough to allow your wrist and arm to move freely.
Spread Your Fingers
Another tip that can be useful for players learning the continental serve grip is to spread your fingers slightly.
When most players first grip their racquet for their serve they have a tendency to crowd their fingers, which can make it harder to control their racquet frame.
If you allow your fingers to spread out a little bit when gripping your racquet you should notice that you have more control and can, therefore, more easily maneuver your racquet head. This is particularly helpful when changing the angle or direction of your racquet for the different types of tennis serves including flat, slice, topspin and kick.
Raise Your Index Finger
Playing on the tip above to spread your fingers, it can also be helpful to lift your index finger so that it reaches further up the racquet handle.
Again, similar to spreading your fingers, extending your index finger up the handle of your tennis racquet will provide you with added stability and control of your tennis racquet through your service motion.
There’s no need to over exaggerate here, but do what feels comfortable.
Switching Grips
At first, you may find it challenging to move quickly from your continental grip to your groundstroke grips and in particular your forehand grip. If you’re having that problem my biggest tip for you is to simply stick with it.
Yes, it does take some time to get comfortable with switching your grip. However, it will pay off in the long run and before you know it switching grips will be second nature – you won’t even have to think about it.
Furthermore, your continental service grip is the same grip you should be using for your volleys and overheads.
This is incredibly important when you learn to serve and volley because you’ll be approaching the net after you serve, which means your opponent’s return is going to reach you quickly and you won’t have any time to adjust your grip.
Tennis Player Serve Grips
Sometimes it can be helpful to see how other players are holding their racquet to get a better feel for the grip you should be using.
In this section, we’ll take a look at the serve grips for Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray and Pete Sampras.

Jon; I move my grip further left than continental when trying to get extra kick on the ball, as did Edberg. No doubt the flex in the wrist is increased with the proper grip. I never, when talking to players, talk about “power”. That word conveys tight muscles. Rather, one should stress racket head speed, just as a golf coach talks of club head speed.
Relaxed and rhythmic is critical to good serving. My high school coach (ex U of Wisconsin) stress the relaxed body, arm and wrist. while serving, and turned out great servers, most of whom played university tennis. ,

Let's talk about Trump and his women....
Kathleen Johnson
May. 23, 2017
With a horrifying swish of his pen, Trump signed yet another executive order early this month bringing “religious liberty” back to America once more. Regardless of Trump’s wording, however, the intentions behind this new EO are anything but liberating.
Signed on the National Day of Prayer, the order grants religious organizations greater freedom when it comes to their involvement in political speech. "We are giving our churches their voices back," Trump said. "Faith is deeply embedded into the history of our country, the spirit of our founding and the soul of our nation. We will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied or silenced anymore."
Trump, who has been anything but shy about his feelings towards the LGBT community, continues to make claims about preserving the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman, making the new order of religious liberty seem more like a hate crime than an act of free speech. In an almost laughable moment during the signing, Trump announced that he and his administration would be "leading by example” to enforce this new order of religious liberty.
So what does a world where Trump “leads by example” really look like? Well, let’s take a look!
Honor thy wife?
Trump, who is currently on his third marriage, seems to treat the supposed sanctity of the institution as an “alternative fact.” In 1977, Trump married his first wife, Ivana Zelnickova, a former model and citizen of Czechoslovakia who went on to give birth to Trump’s three eldest children: Ivanka, Eric, and Donald Trump Jr. Ivana filed for divorce in 1991 after rumors surfaced that Trump was having an affair with Marla Maples, a former beauty queen whom he had met in 1989.
Surprise, surprise! Only a year after finalizing his divorce, Trump married Marla Maples in 1993, two months after she gave birth to their daughter Tiffany. Maples, who became the co-host of Trump's Miss Universe Pageant, filed for separation in 1997 and finalized their divorce in 1999. It had been rumored that Trump was having multiple affairs during his short marriage to Maples, with the list of possible mistresses including such women as Gabriela Sabatini, an Argentinean tennis champion, and Carla Bruni, the former First Lady of France.
In 2005, Trump renewed his efforts to honor the institution of marriage by moving on to wife number three: former model--and now current First Lady--Melania Knauss-Trump. The couple met in 1998 at a Fashion Week party after Trump sent his date to the bathroom so he could flirt with Melania, who was 23 years his junior. I’m not sure about the “first came love” part, but a few years later came marriage, and in 2006 Melania gave birth to Trump’s fifth child, Barron. Oh, and by the way? They currently live in separate homes.
Thou shalt not commit… oh, never mind
Not only is Trump a notorious playboy and cheater, he has also been charged with 12 allegations of sexual assault and misconduct (and that doesn’t even include the allegations of rape made by first wife Ivana over the course of their divorce proceedings). Numerous women have bravely come forward and made claims about our handsy commander-in-chief, stating that he forced himself upon them, grabbed their breasts, slipped his hands up their skirts, and kissed them on the mouth even as they tried to push him away. During the election, Trump threatened to sue any woman who spoke out against him.
And lest you jump to the conclusion that these women are falsely accusing the President for a lark, don’t forget that he was caught admitting to sexually abusive behavior on camera. During the campaign, a behind-the-scenes video from a 2005 taping of Access Hollywood was leaked where Trump bragged about not being able to control himself around beautiful women, stating that he could do anything because he was a celebrity, including grabbing women “by the ” and forcing his tongue in their mouths. Yup, that’s our President.
It seems that Trump’s idea of a pious Christian relationship encompasses adultery, assault, and sexual opportunism--just as long as everyone involved is a card-carrying heterosexual. The President’s own relationship history has made it abundantly clear that Trump values image over ethics, often at the expense of others. So if Trump expects our country to follow in his example, well… please excuse me while I hide in my closet for the next four years.

Cade Rivard, David Sigler Join Rotary Club of Brandon
Posted by Chuck Burgess
on Jul 21, 2015
It was an historic day for the Rotary Club of Brandon this past Tuesday as Cade Rivard and David Sigler began their journey into Rotary by officially joining the Rotary Club of Brandon. Cade, sponsored by John Sellers, was joined by his longtime Rotarian father Roger Rivard and the matriach of the Rivard family, Kimberly Rivard. David was joined by neighbor, friend and even longer time Rotarian, Pat Skidmore, for the ceremony. Both newly pinned Rotarians spoke about their excitement of joining Rotary, and President Chuck Burgess spoke to them both of the honor, prestige and responsibility that comes with being a member of the Rotary Club of Brandon. Cade and David were then handed off to Club Administrator Larry Fassett for their introduction into the Baby Rote program where they will get to learn more about Rotary, the Rotary Club of Brandon and how it operates, and how to get rid of that doggone red badge in order to wear the official blue badge. Cade and David, welcome to THE Rotary Club of Brandon!
In addition to adding two awesome new members at the Club's weekly lunch meeting on Tuesday, July 21st, the Club also welcomed guests Chris Hoffman and Kimberly Rivard (Guests of Roger Rivard) and Donald Morris (Guest of Clyde Eisenberg). It was another packed house with very few empty seats as Rotarians shared the great things going on in their lives. Secretary Debbie Meegan announced the birth of a new 8 lb. 15 ounce grandson and some good news on husband Mike's health, world Rotarian trekker Alan Feldman returned from a great trip with his wife and former Club Rotarian Joan Rhyne and her husband Richard, Felix Velasquez announced the birth of a brand new car which was delivered by Roger Rivard, and Pat Skidmore was the happiest person in the room now that David Sigler will have to pay for his own lunches! The Club also celebrated Debbie Meegan's birthday with one of its best ever Happy Birthday renditions, mainly due to Fred Schwabe starting everyone off in the right key.
Announcements were made regarding the upcoming Board of County Commissioners meeting on Tuesday, August 11th at 9:00AM in the county building. Club members will meet at the Bob Evans for breakfast at 7:30AM and carpool to the meeting afterwards. The Club's monthly board meeting was a huge success with lots of great conversation and planning, all of which will be discussed in front of the entire Club on Tuesday, July 28th. All Brandon Rotarians are encouraged to attend as several topics on the agenda will come forth for discussion and approval. Committees are forming for community service, PR, membership, club administration and fundraising. President Chuck announced that EVERYONE needs to be tied to both fundraising and at least one other committee in order to make this year as successful as it can be. Past President Craig Oldham relayed that he is putting together dates to visit charities receiving funds this year so we may do a big check presentation and bring awareness to both their causes and to our Club's as well. He invited everyone to try and make the check presentations as these were all funds raised by the entire Club.
The Club's first Club Assembly for the 2015-16 Rotary year is scheduled for Tuesday, July 28th. The following Tuesday, August 4th, we get a glimpse into the future of Rotary as we hear from Brandon Rotary's S4TL student, Joe Zukmick. He will join the club for lunch to discuss his experience, what he learned and the impact that this Rotary Leadership youth conference has had on him.
A big reminder went out to the Club inviting everyone to attend our very important social at World of Beer on Thursday, July 30th beginning at 6:00PM! Rotary socials are scheduled in order for our members to enjoy fellowship, invite others to join to learn more about Rotary and our Club, connect with each other, network with other professionals and to have lots of FUN! Our socials are the best place to find out exactly where Mike Cessna gets his hair done, if Chris Papp did more deals in one day than Rotary meetings he made last year (either he is awesome at his job or his GPS doesn't recognize THE LOFT as a destination), what Wayne Strohaker actually does for a living, who is helping Troy Dimsdale with the golf tournament (wait, he's running the golf tournament?!), how many pounds of meat Mike Edenfield HAS actually cooked for our Wild Game dinners and if he's a better attorney, butcher or storyteller, how many countries Alan Feldman has actually visited and how many he is allowed to return to, if Chris Larson actually repairs plumbing at 2:00 in the morning and if so, why are people calling him at 2:00 in the morning, what college Jeff Reynolds' son has chosen and what fraternity Jeff is pledging during his son's first semester, is John Dwyer Brandon's most eligible bachelor, and if so, what does that say for Brandon, who is John Gardner's first mate at his next sailing competition and can they keep up with him, who gets to ride in Joe Campoamor's new boat that goes on water AND on land, or who gets to ride shotgun in Felix Velasquez's new car and learn another language, if Dave Brown realizes he only has 49 more weeks until he is president, who will miss a meeting or make up first, Derrell Curry or Bob Solano (Cal Ripken has nothing on these guys!), if Paul Garner just sells the sound equipment or does he moonlight as DJ PG 13, if Rudy and Craig are each other's dentist, and if so, is that
expected or just weird, if Justin Northcutt will be in a delivery room or will his wife let him be at the social for the birth of his second daughter, how DOES Debbie Meegan deal with being married to the second funniest man in Brandon, will anyone be able to beat Scott Carter in the poker tournament at our Casino Night, will Fred Schwabe be wearing his infamous red tennis shoes and do they actually make him funnier, who will be the next Rotarian to be on Lee Elam's sign and if anyone has seen Bland Eng. Bland? Bland? You never know what stories will be told, what you will learn or what tremendous relationships you will build, so don't miss it!

The UAE Plans to Invest 153 Billion Euros for Energy Diversification
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has recently announced its plans to invest 153 billion euros into a new energy diversification program. The nation hopes, through this investment, to generate more than half its energy from renewable sources by 2050. Discover how ENGIE is active in the region.
The UAE is working towards sourcing its energy renewably, a huge feat considering that this Gulf nation currently ranks eighth on the worldwide list of per capita greenhouse gas emissions. ENGIE is taking part of a global movement for a more sustainable and low-carbon future in power generation, energy efficiency, solar and green mobility.
The UAE’s Renewable Energy Promise
UAE Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bib Rashid al-Maktoum says that he hopes that by 2050, 44 percent of the country’s energy needs will come from renewable energy sources.
The UAE had already set a 5 percent growth target for its non-oil economy as part of the Vision 2021 program.
United Arab Emirates: A Transition from Fossil Fuel to Clean Energy
The United Arab Emirates is currently one of the largest consumers of electricity in the world, and demand for energy continues to increase, with a projected growth rate of 40 percent by 2020. This commitment could therefore have a prodigious impact, not only on energy usage in the region, but on the global average.
This is particularly true given the country’s longtime reliance on fossil fuels. The country currently ranks eighth on the worldwide list of per capita greenhouse gas emissions, and official statements say that the nation is interested in reducing its reliance on fossil fuels to 12 percent by 2050.
The nation – and the Gulf region on the whole – have a particular propensity for solar power, particularly given the advances in this sector of late. A transition to solar in the UAE is likely to reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly.
Efforts towards the transition to renewable energy sources have already been made in Dubai; in June 2016, the city announced its intention to complete construction of a massive solar plant before 2030.
ENGIE in the United Arab Emirates
ENGIE has been active in the United Arab Emirates for quite some time now and is currently the leading private developer of energy and water services in the region, with a presence in the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Recently, ENGIE started construction of the Fadhili independent power project, its fourth project in the Kingdom and the most efficient cogeneration plant to date in the country.
The group has a 20 percent stake in six power and seawater desalinization plants in the UAE, operating a total production capacity of 8.8 GW (on 18 GW of total production in the country) and 2.5 million m3/day of desalinization. It has also been involved in liquefied natural gas (LNG) distribution since August 2013, when it delivered its first LGN carrier in Dubai.
ENGIE energy services in the UAE have included the development of technical maintenance operations and facility management in the Persian Gulf since 2008, through Cofely Besix Facility Management. CBFM is a leading regional facilities manager serving high profile customers such as Masdar City & Institute, Abu Dhabi Ports Company, Emirates SkyCargo, Aldar Properties, Emaar Properties (incl. Dubai Mall and Fountains), Al Sufouh Tramway, etc.
ENGIE Supports Solar Power and Green Mobility
As an active member of the Middle East Solar Industry Association, ENGIE actively supports the dialogue between the public and private sectors in order to implement a solid market framework for solar projects, both for Photovoltaic (PV) and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) tenders. In January 2017, during the first Emirates Electric Vehicle Road Trip, ENGIE promoted charging stations solutions as a contribution to the creation of an infrastructure for electric vehicles in the UAE.

Principal's Message
Dear Parents, Families and Friends:
My name is Seth Hillman and as Principal of Georgetown Middle School, I am energized and deeply committed to making a positive difference in the lives of your children. We will accomplish this by setting high academic expectations for all children and providing supportive systems to assure they are met by addressing school culture, setting high standards for teacher performance, increased academic expectations for all students and engaging the community. It is our goal at Georgetown Middle School for all students to be college and career ready.
I have been privileged to have spent 21 wonderful years as an educator working with students at all three levels of public education. The first 10 years were spent as a classroom teacher instructing on various grade levels. The last 11 years have been as an administrator at Kensington Elementary School, Georgetown High School, and Georgetown Middle School. The commonality in the two decades of experience has been the collaboration with others to provide the best possible education experiences for students.
During the course of the year, it is my hope that we will work together to provide the students of Georgetown Middle School the best possible opportunities in preparing them to be world class citizens ready to take on the challenges of the 21st Century with a solid foundation created here at our school. As Principal, my door is always open and I welcome your input. Please feel free to stop in or call to make an appointment to discuss any concerns, suggestions, or ideas to help make this a fantastic school year!
Thank you,
Seth C. Hillman

Appealing your rates
The Valuation of Land Act 1976 (as amended) Part IV sets out the manner in which objections and appeals may be instituted regarding valuations (GRV or UV).
If you believe your valuation is incorrect you can query it by writing to:
Valuer General's Office
1 Midland Square
Midland WA 6056
telephone: 9273 7373
www.landgate.wa.gov.au
To check the Gross Rental Value (GRV), divide the GRV (located on the Annual Rate Notice) by 52. This gives you the amount that the Valuer General believes is a realistic weekly rental for your property. The Unimproved Valuation (UV) is based on site value (i.e. what the land is worth).
If you decide to query the valuation it must be made within 60 days from the date of issue of your Annual Rate Notice. If you'd like more information, please contact the Valuer General's Office.
Section 6.76 of the Local Government Act 1995 provides the grounds on which, and the time and manner in which, an owner may object or appeal the Rate Book.
If you decide to query the rate book it must be made within 42 days from the date of issue of your Annual Rate Notice to the CEO of the City of Gosnells.
If you decide to query your rates you must still pay the full amount while your objection is being reviewed. If your rates are amended, an Interim Rate Notice will be sent to you, and, if required, a refund would be made.

Piriformis Exercises & Sciatic Nerve Pain Sciatica Muscle Relief
Website Editor Alternative Medicine, Pilates Leave a comment 17,720 Views
Sciatica Symptoms – A Real Pain In The Buttocks
The interesting thing about piriformis sciatic pain (if there can be an interesting thing about pain) is that you cannot find a position that relieves the pain, and yet a simple stretch can alleviate it totally. But what is sciatica really?
A better name for sciatica would be “piriformis syndrome” named after the location of the muscle that is pressing on the sciatic nerve.
I’ve found that the large percentage of sciatic clients have contracted piriformis symptoms. It’s so logical that it amazes me that more medical professionals don’t address this sciatica muscle.
But first, here are…

8 Steps to Pain Free Back with Non Surgical, Natural Treatments & Exercises
Conquer Back and Neck Pain: Walk it Off! Reviews 7 Types of Back Pain
The Anatomy of Sciatic Nerve Pain Symptoms
The sciatic nerve is actually the continuation of the spinal cord. When the cord reaches the sacrum (the flat bone
at the base of your spine) it splits in two. Each division is now called the sciatic nerve, and they head out toward the hips, and go down the backs of your legs. The complicating factor here is that the piriformis muscle originates at exactly the same point where the piriformis sciatic nerve exits the body. The area is called the Greater Sciatic Notch.
If you put your hand into the back pocket of your pants you are right on top of the piriformis. It originates on your sacrum (the big triangular bone at the base of your spine) and goes over to the hip (technically called the greater trochanter). The action of the piriformis is to turn your foot out. Charlie Chaplin’s, famous walk is an example of severe piriformis contraction. People who are most prone to piriformis syndrome are: runners, people who climb many stairs or work out on a stair climbing machine at the gym, individuals who sit for many hours at a stretch (including in a car or at a desk), and men who keep their wallets in their back pockets.
Why Sciatica Muscle Pains Occur
Both the piriformis and the sciatic nerve begin at your tailbone (coccyx). The piriformis crosses directly on top of the sciatic nerve, and this is what causes the problem. When the muscle goes into a spasm it presses down directly onto the nerve, pushing it into the bone underneath. And you get the terrible pain of sciatica.
If you get tested for nerve impingement, you will get a positive reading – because the nerve is being trapped, but by a muscle, not between bones. If you remove the muscle, you stop the pain. You need to take the pressure off the nerve.
How to Stop Sciatic Nerve Pain with a Tennis Ball
Here is a treatment that has been extremely successful in our medical practice. To do it you need a tennis ball:
Lie on your back on the floor (not the bed). Have your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor.
Place the tennis ball where your back pocket would be. Now gently roll onto the ball.
Stop each time the pain is moving toward intolerable.
Stay there for 30 seconds…then roll further onto the ball.
Do this until you are completely on the ball and you are feeling absolutely no pain. Stay there for one full minute.
If you feel pain during that minute, move off a bit, take a breath, and begin again.
You should be able to stay on the ball for one minute comfortably.
Do this treatment every day, but remember to stay well within your own pain tolerance level. This treatment should
feel good; if it hurts, you are pressing too hard, so back off until you are at the “feels good” level.
You are in control of your treatment.
Next, Dr. Leia Melead will answer an important question regarding using the tennis ball to relieve your pain. The comment section at the bottom of the page is also packed with useful questions and answers that can help you release sciatic nerve issues.
Piriformis Exercises to Relieve Sciatica Pain
Question for Dr. Leia: Please can you explain further where to place the tennis ball? Does it start above the hip joint and roll up the body? Can this technique provide piriformis relief?
Dr. Leia’s Answer: The tennis ball should be placed under one buttock right where a back pocket of your slacks would appear. If you have a back pocket in your slacks, you can lie with your pocket directly over the ball.
You should lie on your back with your legs bent, and slowly experiment with putting light pressure on the ball. Be very careful when trying this self-help technique not to put too much pressure on the ball all at once, but to gradually roll your weight over the ball.
This should be a feel-good exercise, and not a painful one. If you experience pain immediately stop the exercise. Also, it is very important not to place the ball directly over your spinal column or back bone. The ball should be placed only on one side of the buttocks at one time.
After gently rolling over the ball on one side, you can then try using it on the other side to see if this helps. Usually people experience sciatic pain only on one side of the body, however gentle rolling and massaging can be done on both sides of the body.
I hope that this explains the technique more thoroughly. You might also want to consider having acupuncture done for your sciatic problem. Acupuncture is extremely effective in treating this condition.

?US intelligence on Iran is inadequate?
A top member of the Congressional Intelligence Panel have said that the US does not have good intelligence on how close Tehran is to developing nuclear weapons.
india Updated: Apr 24, 2006 04:59 IST

At a time when the Bush administration is pressurising Iran for its nuclear programme, a top member of the Congressional Intelligence Panel have said that the US does not have good intelligence on how close Tehran is to developing nuclear weapons.
"I'd say we really don't know. We're getting lots of mixed messages. Obviously, we're getting lots of different messages from their leadership, the stuff that they are saying in public", remarked Republican Chair of the House Permanent Select Commission on Intelligence, Peter Hoekstra.
"It all points out the fact we need to do much better in rebuilding our intelligence community, reshaping it, transforming it, making sure that we give public policy -- that we give policymakers the information that they need so that we can make better decisions", he said in the course of a Sunday Talk Show.
Pressed whether the United States really did not know what was taking place in Teheran, Hoekstra responded, "Sometimes it's better to be honest and to say there's a whole lot we don't know about Iran that I wish we did know, and we as public policymakers need to know that as we're moving forward and as decisions are being made on Iran, we don't have all of the information that we would like to have."
The Senior Democrat in the House Panel, Jane Harman seconded what Hoekstra remarked.
"We don't know. Our intelligence is thin. I don't think we have enough sources. I don't think our sis is sharp enough", the California Democrat said.

WikiLeaks publishes leaked French President Macron’s campaign emails on website
The head of France’s cybersecurity agency ANSSI said in June there was no evidence tying the hacking of the Macron campaign emails to any particular actor, saying ‘it could be anyone’.
world Updated: Jul 31, 2017 18:14 IST
Press Trust of India, Paris
French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace in Paris on Monday.(Reuters)
WikiLeaks says it’s taking the roughly 20,000 emails allegedly stolen from French President Emmanuel Macron’s campaign and publishing them to its website in a searchable form.
The emails caused a stir when they were initially published just two days before France’s May 7 presidential run-off, which pitted Macron against French far-right leader Marine Le Pen.
But unlike the leaks that rattled the 2016 American presidential race, the French email leak had little if any impact. Macron still handily beat Le Pen.
The messages have since been picked over by the French press, although WikiLeaks’ move may draw new attention to them.
The head of France’s cybersecurity agency ANSSI said in June there was no evidence tying the hacking of the Macron campaign emails to any particular actor, saying “it could be anyone.”

"Perfect retreat for a family celebration weekend"
When family and friends are scattered round the country, if not the globe, it can be daunting to organise a get-together which includes accommodation and activities. For a special celebration, perhaps a "big" birthday, Horsted Place can be booked exclusively for a memorable house party. Successful parties have included a barbecue, treasure hunt in the garden or fireworks - you may have your own ideas! We would be delighted to help plan a programme tailored to your guests' ages and interests so that you can then relax and really enjoy the occasion in your own fully staffed country house.
Your guests can also play golf, tennis and croquet or swim in the heated indoor pool at the nearby East Sussex National.
For more information about taking exclusive use of Horsted Place, please contact our Events Co-ordinator on 01825 750581.

Treadmill TechnoGym Artis Run U-GO
With its unique design, the Treadmill TechnoGym Artis Run U-GO is perfect for those who not only want their treadmill to have a lot of functions, but also to look great. The adaptable running area was designed to adjust to different running styles, thus allowing each user to enjoy just the kind of training they like. Being only 24cm from the ground, the running area is large enough to allow for a comfortable workout. The Treadmill TechnoGym Artis Run U-GO is the first and only treadmill to have implemented precisely defined ergonomic standards regarding positioning and inclination of the user interface, i.e. the levers for speed/incline adjustment and optimal display angle. Since the specially shaped handles have heart rate sensors built into them, you can set you own heart rate zone and thus make full use of the CPR program which automatically adjusts the speed and incline to keep you in your heart rate zone. With the top speed of 25 km/h, the Treadmill TechnoGym Artis Run U-GO allows you to give your best.
Thanks to its brushless drive and low friction materials, the Treadmill TechnoGym Artis Run U-GO has lower energy consumption (30%) than other treadmills in its class. Moreover, this treadmill also has a number of useful features – motion detectors which bring the belt to a stop when the treadmill is not in use (Runner Detection System); diodes at the end of the handles which are red when the treadmill is in use and green when it is safe for the user to step onto the treadmill (InMotion System). Last, but not least, the Treadmill TechnoGym Artis Run U-GO does not require lubrication, making it maintenance-free.
The main feature of the Treadmill TechnoGym Artis Run U-GO, however, is a multifunctional LED display which can be connected to the Internet. It allows you to follow your current training data such as time, distance, calories burned, etc. Moreover, you can also use the display to check your favorite websites, play games, watch videos or listen to music. It also features a USB port which you can use to recharge all kinds of devices, e.g. your cell phone. The Treadmill TechnoGym Artis Run U-GO will take your training to another level.
No lubrication
Thanks to a unique technology, the Treadmill TechnoGym Artis Run U-GO does not require lubrication (oils or other lubricants could cause damage to the treadmill), making it maintenance-free.

Elegant, ergonomic design
Soft, adaptable and ultra wide running area

Running shoes help
Detecting the individual length One foot
Take a piece of paper (A4) and place it on a flat, stable surface (we recommend the floor). Place your right foot (or your stronger, longer foot) diagonally, so that it fits completely within the sheet of paper.
With the thinnest possible pen, starting with the heel of your foot start to trace around your foot, you continue until you complete the entire foot (see Fig.). If you choose, you can trace only the longest point of your foot, that would suffice.
Determine the length of your feet
Next, you have to measure the width of your stronger / longer foot. Measure this with a ruler or tape measure the distances between the two points that are furthest apart in [cm/in] (see Figure - vertical line).
Important: Then You add [1 centimeter (cm)/ ½ an inch (.5”)] to and have your exact running shoe size in [cm/in] determined!
Example: Your measurement has resulted in a distance of [27 cm/10”]. Now add [1 cm/.5”] to find your shoe size is [28 cm/10.5”]!
We have the converted nearly all shapes and lengths to the correct sizes for all of the brands (Asics, Nike, adidas, etc.for you so you can know your correct size regardless of which brand or model shoe you want to buy.

Living in Ascot
Not surprisingly for the Royal County, the Ascot area is well known of course for Ascot race course and the Royal Ascot Meeting in particular in June each year, but also for polo, particularly at Guards Polo Club and golf for which the area is extremely well served by golf courses such as Wentworth Club, Sunningdale golf club and Swinley Forest.
The first thing that strikes you when you arrive in this area is how leafy it is. Whilst it is only 11 miles from Terminal 5, Heathrow airport and 30 miles from Central London, the area has a country feel but having all the advantages of communication for London, the West Country, Heathrow and Gatwick airports together with the national motorway network of the M25, M3 and M4.
From its relatively humble beginnings in 1711, Royal Ascot race course has become arguably the most famous race course in the UK. Today, Ascot is a warm and lively town with plenty of shops and restaurants including Starbucks, Boots and W H Smiths.
The centre offers everything from jazz bars to boutiques, the ideal place for a delicious meal on a summers evening or a quiet drink in a local pub.
Why use Knight Frank
The Ascot office of Knight Frank have operated in the Ascot area for over 40 years so with the combined experience of over 50 years, our team in Ascot has all the experience and know how to help you with all your property requirements.
Do contact our team who will be delighted to assist you whether it being a search for a property or a valuation request.

Award-winning e-commerce for Casall
“I am very pleased with our new e-commerce solution. We have only scratched the surface so far but are already doubling last year’s sales every month.”
Jon Lööf, CEO Casall
Award-winning e-commerce for Casall
“I am very pleased with our new e-commerce solution. We have only scratched the surface so far but are already doubling last year’s sales every month.”
Jon Lööf, CEO Casall
Swedish designer brand Casall has marketed workout clothing and gear since its inception in 1984. Even though the company has had its own online store since the end of the 1990s, it felt like it had not really kept up with development — and only 1% of the company’s sales were through its own channels.
“We adopted e-commerce early on and launched our first online store in 1997. Even so, it feels like we missed the boat when the real upswing hit. We had relied on an old solution for a long time, and realized that the time had come for a complete makeover,” says CEO Jon Lööf, Casall Sport AB.
Digital channels — key to reaching international market
When Jon Lööf took over as CEO in 2017, his primary task was to transform what had basically become stagnated growth into an international expansion. Casall was already active in several markets, but very few people were aware of the brand outside of the Nordic area. Efforts to ensure a successful launch in an international market started from scratch.
“Right before I started working at Casall, a new design manager and a new brand manager were also hired. The first thing we asked ourselves was who the consumer is and what his or her values are. Based on this information, we produced a new brand platform.”
Jon Lööf realized that in order to develop the brand and promote growth, the company’s digital presence needed to be developed. Casall needed to begin focusing on its own channels instead of relying entirely on distribution.
“We knew that our digital channels would become the cornerstones of our international expansion, so we focused our efforts there.”
Challenges during requirements specification and implementation — multitude of lessons learned
Deciding on a new e-commerce solution was one thing but knowing exactly what was needed was not as straightforward.
“A great deal of the legwork had already been done when I came to the company. I more or less inherited the order for a new e-commerce solution. For this reason, it took a while before I understood what we actually needed from the new solution.”
Jon Lööf and Casall learned a lot during the requirements specification and implementation phases of the new e-commerce solution and are today in a position to advise other companies on the brink of a similar investment.
“It is important to work through the order thoroughly. What role is e-commerce to have? What is the objective of the new e-commerce site? When specifying requirements, don’t focus on what you want to do with the online store or the site, but rather on what you want to do with the brand.”
Great start with good basics — but still a lot left to do
Litium’s cloud-based e-commerce platform was ultimately selected, in large part because Litium was perceived as a stable player with a great reputation in the industry. Sales are more frequently being conducted online, but Jon Lööf recognizes that there is still a lot left to do to improve the company’s chances of reaching its objectives.
“Our current online store is based on Litium’s e-commerce platform and includes an integrated CMS. However, we have not connected the PIM segment to the platform yet. This will be the next obvious step. As it stands today, we take care of product management manually, which is arduous. We want to get closer to our consumers and be able to introduce new products and offers on a more continuous basis. I am also looking forward to having a PIM system in place to simplify the process of adding new markets as we continue to grow internationally.”
Before Casall’s new investment in e-commerce, the company’s digital presence consisted of two separate websites: one that provided inspiration and one that was a separate online store. In order to achieve the best possible conditions for the investment to succeed, the two parts were merged to blend inspiration with e-commerce.
“Integrating content and products enabled a better e-commerce experience. Now we want to fill the page with even more relevant content for our customers.”
Acclaimed award winner — with already measurable results
Thanks to the thorough legwork that was done in relation to both the brand and the needs sis, Casall’s new e-commerce solution is a success story.
“The feedback on our new e-commerce solution has been extremely positive, especially in terms of visual aspects such as the imagery and design. Since Casall is a designer brand, we are particular about our online shop reflecting this, so it is especially gratifying that the new site received the Svenska Designpriset award for its functionality and attractive design.”
Even though Casall’s new e-commerce solution is not even a year old, the company can already see clear results from the new online store and site.
“I am very pleased with our new e-commerce solution. We have only scratched the surface so far but are already doubling last year’s sales every month.”

ABOUT THE BOOK:
As David White explains in the introduction to Tantra in Practice. Tantra is an Asian body of beliefs and practices that seeks to channel the divine energy that grounds the universe, in creative and liberating ways. The subsequent chapters reflect the wide geographical and temporal scope of Tantra by examining thirty-six texts from China India, Japan, Nepal, and Tibet, ranging from the seventh century to the present day, and representing the full range of Tantric experience Buddhist, Hindu, Jain and even Islamic. Each text has been chosen and translated, often for the first time, by an international expert in the field who also provides detailed background material. Students of Asian religions and general readers alike will find the book rich and informative.
The books includes plays, trancribed interviews, poetry, parodies, inscriptions, instructional texts, scriptures, philosophical conjectures, dreams, and astronomical speculations, each text illustrating one of the diverse traditions and practices of Tantra. Thus the nineteenth-century Indian Buddhist Garland of Gems, a series of songs, warns against the illusion of appearance by referring to bees, yogurt, and the fire of Malaya Mountain; while fourteenth-century Chinese Buddhist manuscripts detail how to prosper through the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper by burning incense, making offerings to scriptures, and chanting incantations. In a transcribed conversation, a modern Hindu priest in Bengal candidly explains how he serves the black goddess Kali and feeds temple skulls lentils, wine or nice. A seventeenth-century Nepalese Hindu praise-poem hammered into the golden doors to the temple of the Goddess Taleju lists a king's faults and begs her forgiveness and grace. An introduction accompanies each text, identifying its period and genre, discussing the history and incluence of the work, and identifying points of particular interest or difficulty.

Review:
"Written by an experienced spiritual practitioner, the book gives an authentic overview of the subject in accordance with tradition, with an emphasis on the practical aspects … will certainly provide a useful overview of the yoga techniques while giving practical hints to their practice." Prabuddha Bharata, Vol.105, No.8, August 2002 - Swami Satyaswarupananda, Belur Math
"...contains all techniques for understanding, and controlling the mind. Raja, Hatha, Karma, Kundalini, Jnana and Mantra Yoga-all are discussed in detail. The Raja Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, one of the greatest psychologists of all time, are given in their entirety with commentary. Several modern methods are scrutinised... a psychological study, a guide for practice and source of great learning." Mother India, Vol. LII, No.8, 1999 - Anonymous
"The methods presented in this book follow the tradition from which all the four Yogic paths of Raja, Karma, Jnana and Bhakti stem out... Yogas are so well explained that even a lay reader will have little difficulty in grasping and understanding the techniques to control the mind... helps to dispel most of the misgivings of misguided souls and can be a veritable treasure to any ardent seeker." The Astrological Magazine, Vol.90, No.1, January 2001 - VSK
ABOUT THE BOOK:
This volume is intended to dispel the cloud of confusion that has accumulated around the subject of meditation. Those who are looking for secret short-cuts, novel innovations, exciting new trends and fads in the area of self-development may be disappointed. The methods presented here stem from the classic four path of Raja Yoga, Karma Yoga, Jnana Yoga and Bhakti Yoga. These are given in their uncorrupted form, yet with consideration for the Western mind and scientific tradition.

Borg vs. McEnroe
It's the summer of 1980, and Björn Borg is the top tennis player in the world, dominating the sport both on and off the court. A powerful and rigorously disciplined player, there is only one obstacle in his pursuit of a record-breaking fifth Wimbledon championship: the highly talented but ferociously abrasive young American John McEnroe. With three days until the tournament begins, Borg trains religiously in his lavish Monaco home, aided by his coach and mentor Lennart and girlfriend Mariana.

COMFORT AGGIORNATO, STILE VINTAGE.
La scarpa Nike Cortez 72 - Donna riprende una classica silhouette da running per offrire il massimo comfort per tutti i giorni con pelle premium e suola a strati per un'ammortizzazione aggiornata. Dettagli d'ispirazione vintage quali rinforzo testurizzato sulla punta, bordatura seghettata e linguetta sul tallone, rievocano il modello originale.
Vantaggi del prodotto
Tomaia in pelle pieno fiore premium per la massima resistenza
Intersuola in schiuma EVA per un comfort ammortizzato
Suola in gomma con disegno a spina di pesce per un'aderenza ottimale
Origini della Cortez
La scarpa Nike Cortez, primo capolavoro di Bill Bowerman, è stata concepita per essere più leggera e resistente alle intemperie di qualsiasi altro modello. Nel 1972, ha introdotto nel mondo del running un sistema di ammortizzazione senza precedenti, divenendo rapidamente la calzatura da training più popolare nel paese. Icona inconfondibile che raccontava la tua storia e dichiarava la tua appartenenza, questa scarpa tanto innovativa ha presto cominciato a dominare le strade di Los Angeles con il suo stile fiero e grintoso. Da allora, nessun'altra calzatura ha rivoluzionato il concetto di scarpa da running come la Nike Cortez.

How the Royal Caribbean Ship Classes Work
Share this
By JoFriday 08th September 2017
When you're booking your Royal Caribbean holiday destination, one of the first questions is: which ship class is right for me? Whether you're sailing with your family, friends, partner or as a solo traveller, our guide will point you in the right direction.
Quantum Class
Ships: Anthem, Ovation and Quantum
Good for: Families and couples
On their debut, the Quantum Class ships were the second largest in the world, and can accommodate nearly 5,000 passengers.
Accommodation
The accommodation is designed with your comfort in mind. The ships feature customisable staterooms, stunning ocean views, and even two-storey lofts with private whirlpools. You're guaranteed a stylish, comfortable room, no matter what your budget is.
Features
Quantum Class ships aren't the largest of our cruise ships - but size isn't everything! The Quantum Class ships come with a whole range of features that are guaranteed fun for all the family, young and old.
The North Star: This futuristic pod will take you 300ft up in the air, for 360° views of the ship and the perfect blue ocean that surrounds it. Remember to book your sunset or sunrise elevation before you set off.
SeaPlex: Race around on the dodgems, and try out your roller disco moves at SeaPlex. At night, it's transformed into the perfect place to party the night away.
Ripcord by iFLY: Sail and fly, all at the same time! Safely experience what it's like to skydive, in our state of the art simulator.
Oasis Class
Ships: Allure, Harmony, Oasis and Symphony
Good for: Families
The Oasis Class are the world's largest cruise ships, and are divided into seven distinct neighbourhoods, each one bringing something special. If you want a ship packed with adventures, and all the fun Royal Caribbean can offer, then Oasis Class are the ships for you.
Accommodation
Stylish, luxurious, and comfortable. Your stateroom is your home from home. When you can finally pull yourself away from the unique features of the ship, you won't be sorry to return to your room. Oasis Class ships come with family rooms, which are intersecting rooms that can open up for family time, or be closed for privacy.
Features
There won't be a dull moment when onboard an Oasis Class ship. The ships are packed full of daring activities, heart-stopping entertainment and fantastic restaurants; on Harmony you can even be served your drinks by robot bartenders.
Seven Neighbourhoods: This is unique to Oasis Class ships. The seven neighbourhoods divide the ship and give each section their own look and feel.
Central Park: This is the only living park on the seas, and the perfect place for a wander, dinner or shopping trip.
Royal Promenade: Parades, amazing bars, shopping experiences… What's more to want?
Boardwalk: Have fun on the arcades and amusements. Visit the Aquatheatre, where you can watch daring entertainment.
Pool and Sports Zone: There is so much to do here, the rock climbing walls, zip lines and FlowRider are great ways to fill up your day when you're at sea.
Slides: Join us on Harmony, if your little ones (or bigger ones) love wild waterslides. They can see how brave they are as they take on The Ultimate Abyss and The Perfect Storm.
Vitality Spa and Fitness: Sit back, relax, or get involved in some heart-thumping exercise classes.
Entertainment Place: Catch a Broadway show, or hit the casino. The fun doesn't stop!
Youth Zone: The perfect place for our younger guests to hang out with workshops, video games and more!
Freedom Class
Ships: Freedom, Independence and Liberty
Good for: Families
Until the Oasis Class came about, these were the largest cruise ships in the world. These ships are perfect for those who want to have an active time onboard.
Accommodation
With balcony staterooms that overlook the ocean, twin staterooms, family staterooms with an ocean view and grand suites, there is something for everyone onboard a Freedom Class ship. Maybe you'll get to be the lucky guest who stays in the Ben & Jerry's themed stateroom. It's located above the shop, and guests who stay there will receive complimentary Ben & Jerry's ice cream and access to the concierge lounge.
Features
Whether you want to stay active onboard, or are after something a bit more chilled, there won't be much chance of getting bored.
Ice Skating: Release your inner Michelle Kwan and take to our ice skating rink! Skate during the day, and come back at night to experience the dazzling ice show.
Rock Wall: There are all sorts of places to experience an amazing view onboard, but the rock wall is one of the best! How fast can you climb up to the top?
Sports Courts: If you want to keep your fitness up, there are plenty of ways to do that onboard. Whether it's shooting some hoops on the basketball court, lapping your friends on the running track or playing table tennis, there's no excuse not to get out there and move!
Slides: Liberty of the Seas® has recently been updated to include jaw-dropping waterslides. Whizz down Tidal Wave, Typhoon, Cyclone and Splashaway Bay. Independence of the Seas® is also being revitalised, and will also feature amazing new slides, and much more.
Radiance Class
Ships: Brilliance, Jewel, Radiance and Serenade
Good for: Couples
These ships interior uses a lot of glass to create a beautifully open area. As well as the magical views, Radiance offers delectable dining and stand out entertainment, for a holiday you'll never forget.
Accommodation
Comfortable staterooms, stylish suites and beautiful ocean views. When you head back to your room after an exciting day of adventures, you'll be sure to have a relaxing night's sleep.
Features
There is a great mix of luxurious spa treatments for some me-time and sporting activities to stay fit and healthy onboard.
Adults Only Solarium: The perfect place for a dip and R&R. Take some blissful kid-free time for yourself!
Spa: Treat yourself and relax to the sound of ocean waves at our state of the art spa.
Mini Golf: As well as basketball, pool tables and a running track, why not see if you can get a hole in one on our mini golf course?
Voyager Class
Ships: Adventure, Explorer, Mariner, Navigator and Voyager
Good for: Couples and Families
Voyager Class ships are where ‘firsts' happen. They were the first to have an ice rink, and the Royal Promenade, so you know that you're in for a unique experience when you step onboard.
Accommodation
Technology is at the forefront of our staterooms, with virtual balconies, showing the real-time views from the deck on Explorer, Navigator and Voyager.
Features
From Broadway shows to incredible pools, there are plenty of things to get up to during your days at sea.
Al Fresco Films: Lie back by our pool, and catch a blockbuster or international sporting events on the big screen.
Take in a Broadway Show: Of an evening, stop by the theatre for a Broadway style show. Musicals and family favourites are on the bill!
Whirlpools: After a long day exploring, chill under the sun in the whirlpools.
Sovereign Class
Ship: Majesty
Best for: Families and couples
There is only one ship in Sovereign Class, making it even more special. With an outdoor movie screen, super-fun Splashaway Bay, the ocean's fastest internet VOOM, and delicious restaurants, you'll make lots of special memories here.
Accommodation
The newly refurbished staterooms and suites offer great spaces for families and couples. Majesty's rooms are designed to make you feel like you're coming home.
Features
Perfect for family fun, and a bit of rest and relaxation for adults. No matter your age, or what holiday experience you're after, you can have the time of your life here.
Splashaway Bay: Kids (and grown-ups) will have a whale of a time at Splashaway Bay. Waterslides, fantastic pools… this is a water park you definitely don't want to miss out on.
Dance the Night Away: When the sun goes down, the fun doesn't stop. Head to our nightclub, and party into the small hours with your fellow guests.
Empress Class
Ship: Empress
Good for: Couples
If you're after a mini-break, this is the ship for you. It's designed for short cruises between three and five days. Even though it's not designed for longer holidays, you won't be short-changed with entertainment and activities onboard.
Accommodation
Comfortable rooms await you on Empress of the Seas®. The perfect place to chill after a long day of exploring.
Features
The ship has many of the same features as the others in our fleet, such as the rock wall, casino and spa.
Pools: There are several pools onboard. Ideal if you want a splash and a dip, or just to relax under the golden sun.
Casino: Feeling lucky tonight? Then roll the dice at our onboard casino. Will you win big?
Vision Class
Ship: Vision
Good for: Families and couples
Vision is the ship that pleases everyone. Whether you want to get involved in lots of fun packed adventures or just chill out onboard, you'll be happy on Vision.
Accommodation
After a long day exploring, there's nothing better than returning to your room and chill out. From staterooms to suites, sit back and relax in your Royal Caribbean home from home.
Features
As this is a ship for everyone, there are activities for everyone. You will be able to easily fill your days onboard.
Pools: There is a family friendly pool that you can splash about it, and a pool only for adults for a more relaxing dip.
Rock Climbing Wall: Think you are champion climber? Then see if you can be the first to get to the top of the Vision of the Seas® rock climbing wall!
Hit the Dancefloor: It's always party time onboard Vision! Dance the night away, have a tail and have the night of your life at our onboard nightclub!
Project Icon
We are always looking for new was to innovate and add to our fleet, and the new Icon class ships are arriving in 2022 and 2024. They are built using new fuel technology including liquid nitrogen gas and fuel cells. This technology has been used on space shuttles and satellites for years, and is a much greener way of powering ships.
So, which of our ships will you be joining us on? Whichever one you choose, you're guaranteed the holiday of a lifetime!

Gallery: Hundreds in Syracuse have their heads shaved to help fight childhood cancer
By Chris Baker | cbaker@syracuse.com
SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- On Sunday afternoon at Kitty Hoyne's, being bald was all the rage. The downtown pub hosted its annual St. Baldrick's Foundation fundraiser. Over 500 people shaved their heads in an effort to raise money for a cure for childhood cancer. "It's the best feeling," said Lisa Eddy as she ran her hand over a freshly shaved scalp. Now in its 11th year, the Syracuse St. Baldrick's event has grown to the second largest of its kind in the nation. Sophia Meskos was one of several volunteer organizers at Sunday's shave-a-thon. This year, 560 people signed up to have their heads shaved, she said. It was Meskos' job to make sure all those people made it to the barber's chair over the course of the seven-hour day.
Last year
, Meskos said, the Kitty Hoyne's event raised $492,000. As of noon, Sunday, they had hit the $370,000 mark, with money continuing to flow in. "It's going to be hard to top last year," she said. "But we hope to raise $500,000."
About 550 people signed up to have their heads shaved. The annual St. Baldrick's Foundation fundraiser was held on Sunday March 1, 2015 at Kitty Hoynes in Armory Square. With a goal of $400-thousand the money will be used to support research into childhood cancer cures.
Meskos estimated up to 5,000 people would walk through the doors to Kitty Hoyne's Sunday. David Hoyne has been hosting the event at his bar since 2005. "We do this every year because we kind of have to," he said. "Even though the money is making an impact and the cure rate is going up, we're nowhere near beating it." Throughout the day, people took turns at barber chairs in two different parts of the bar. Greg Coleman, one of the volunteer barbers, said it took about five minutes to shave each head. All the while, master of ceremonies Chow Downey wandered the bar announcing fundraising totals and sharing stories from the shavees. "Chow spends hours researching all the people and their stories," Hoyne said. "It's not just 'number 400' to him. It's a person with a story." Team Griffin, for example, brought parents and friends together to remember Griffin Engle, who died Sept. 12, 2014 of a brain tumor. He was seven years old. The team wore matching t-shirts with a Detroit Red Wings-inspired logo. "He was a huge Red Wings fan," said his mother, Erin Engle. "And he was a hockey player. Number 13 was his favorite." In other cases, people gathered in support of children whose battle is ongoing, like Abby M., who was diagnosed three years ago today and is now in remission. One young girl, Cassidy, a friend of Abby's, held freshly clipped pigtails in each hand, grinning ear to ear after shaving her long, red hair. "It feels weird!" she said as friends cheered her on and Abby's mother sat in the chair next to her. The event brought together families, friends and even spectators looking to share in the festivities. "It's fun but it's serious too," Hoyne said. "There are sad people here, even if you don't see it."

Quotes from users
Tennis Ticket Service got me the most amazing seats for Roland Garros and the staff even advised me on a hotel.
Richard
Visiting the Australian Open was such a carefree experience for me and my husband thanks to you!
Corina
Because the customer service is so easily accessible, I have at the last moment been able to book an extra card for a friend of mine. In the end we went to Roland Garros with 3 men.
Bertrand Dubront
In 2017 to the Monte Carlo Masters, the event was not offered on the website but after one phone call received a proposal and myself secured tickets myself for the ATP tournament.
Diana Wilson
Through Tennis Ticket Service to the quarter finals of the US Open, thanks to the good service and clear explanation had no problems with the mobile tickets.
Karel Dunnewind
Had a super day at Roland Garros in 2017! Fine places, timely delivery and fun matches seen!
Ellis Williams
I order every year at Tennis Ticket Service because I can always go with questions and always be helped correctly.
Juan Ramos
The tickets were on time. Unfortunately, the category I chose was no longer available (Category 3) and I received Category 2 as a free upgrade!

Barre
Moves from ballet, Pilates and yoga to work every muscle in your body. Barre makes you stronger, more flexible and realigns you – so that everything’s back where it should be. Ballerinas are tough, and this class proves it.
SEE THE TIMETABLE
HIIT
Exercise as hard and fast as you can for a short burst, then slow things down for a brief recovery period. Then do it again. And again. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) melts calories, and pushes your heart and lungs to their limits.
SEE THE TIMETABLE
Yoga
Yoga classes help you stay supple, in shape and chilled out. It can be vigorous and dynamic or slow and meditative. Find the yoga that suits you and help your body unwind as much as your body.
