Celebrating St. Patrick’s Day in the Twin Cities with 6 Irish Venues!
St. Patrick’s Day Parade
St. Paul’s St. Patrick’s Day Parade will begin at noon at the corner of 4th Street and Sibley in downtown St. Paul. The parade will travel west on 4th to Rice Park (4th and Market). See bagpipers, heritage groups, families, business officials, and performers take over the streets of downtown and Lowertown St. Paul as 4th Street turns into a sea of green with music, dance and merriment.
The Local
Their doors welcome you into the old world. In contrast with reputations in the lore of the Irish, their food is high priority. Fish & Chips, the classics and more than a few ringers for the worldly eaters. The craic is good. There’s always something to watch, even when the rugby isn’t on the screen. This year for St. Patrick’s Day they are giving away a prize package which includes reserve seating for you and 7 of your besties with a $500 gift card to party the day away!

Caroline and Amelia enlist Will the footman to deliver some counterfeit invitations to a forthcoming dinner party. Governess Miss Blake finds out the plot, and disciplines all three conspirators with the cane.
Amelia's father is hosting a dinner party, and she and Caroline have hatched a plan to swap the invited guests from boring bachelors to interesting young men. They enlist Will, one of the footmen, to deliver the new counterfeit invitations. Unfortunately Will is intercepted by governess Miss Blake before he can complete his errand, and all three are in big trouble.
Disappointed that the discipline she has administered before has clearly had no good effect, Miss Blake threatens to tell Amelia's father about the prank and send Caroline away. The girls beg her not to tell him, but Miss Blake is adamant that such outright rebellion deserves severe punishment. She shocks the girls by telling them that instead, they will each receive twelve hard strokes of the cane from her.
Amelia's governess Miss Blake is not much older than the two young ladies and they are used to thinking of her as a friend, but now they see another side of her. She is responsible for them and after such disgraceful disobedience she is determined to correct them, whatever it may take.
Once the girls have been disciplined, Miss Blake turns her attentions to her young cousin, Will. She was glad to be able to find him a place in the household and knows that her aunt and uncle cannot afford for him to lose his position, which is what would happen if she were to report his behaviour. She also knows that if she were discovered to be covering for him, they would both be at risk. She is therefore obliged to punish him as well, if he will accept it from his own cousin; after all, she is his elder and senior to him in position. Will knows he has erred in letting the charming young ladies draw him into their conspiracy, and submits to correction from Miss Blake in the form of six strokes of the cane.
This is the sequel to The Edwardian Governess.

Genre Equality
Posted by Sheldon at 21:18 on 21 Jul 2013
Beautiful and exciting film. The four characters are perfect, although the bottoming of Amelia deserves an extra star. Hoewever, I am rather critical with the severe governess, since she does not allow poor Will to watch the delicious bottoms of Amelia and Carolyne when they are caned. Where is the "genre equality"LOL. An additinal detail the customs are perfect ,but it is strange to see a radiator so modern during the Victorian time. Jokes apart, congratulations to Pandora and her team for a great film that keeps the high standars of creativity and artistic quality of this site.

Ah, if only it was easier to deal with radiators! One of the items on my props wishlist is a radiator cover like this one that I can carry to shoots and use as required...

I don't think they were as keen on gender equality in the Edwardian period :) The modesty of the womens must be protected! Cameras don't count. ;)

Ouch! Poor Caroline and Amelia! At the end of a two days' shooting that might have been a bit much, I think. Generally I only write very hard punishments for myself, or spankees who request it. Because consent. :)

Terrific Idea and Staging
Posted by dreaming at 12:14 on 25 Jul 2013
Pandora, I only recently discovered your wonderful work but you tick all my spanking boxes! I am especially happy with your delight in the punishment of male and female together and this video is an excellent example of what I want to regard as a genre all by itself.
If I have a criticism of this one it is that your wielding of the cane sometimes seems a little bit rigid. I know you must be aware that some are able to inflict any degree of severity with the merest flick of the cane whilst others draw back further, hold the implement rigidly and produce an impact more like that of a solid wooden implement than of a relatively light, whippy stick. If the cane is directed towards its target but arrested a moment before impact, the flexible tip of the cane can continue under its own momentum until it strikes and produces the characteristic stinging effect rather than the more bruising impact of a rigid item like a paddle.
I didn't intend this to end up as a caning master-class but your work is so excellent that I want it to be perfect. I love your ideas and attention to detail.

Cool. I'm always interested in constructive criticism and particularly in improving my cane technique. I'll look into it and ask some of the experts amongst my friends for a few pointers :)
Really glad you like the scene. I love films of boys and girls punished together and they are proving some of the most popular films on this site so far. I can't believe no-one else is doing it!

What a fabulous video !!! Wish I was a co conspirator in this naughtiness and lining up for the cane too..... Think the footman should have got at least the same number of strokes as the girls

Thanks! Glad you liked it :)
You might be right regarding the footman, but it was Will's first shoot with us and he didn't know how badly he would mark from the cane, and had a stage performance two days after this shoot (he works as a male stripper). He said he was happy to try the cane but wanted to keep marking to a minimum, so we agreed on six relatively light strokes as a compromise. He took it really well, and next time I shoot with him I'll be comfortable taking things a bit further. I'll definitely arrange for our shoot to be a bit further away from his next stage show next time!

FM spanking
Posted by Adam at 15:54 on 28 Jul 2013
What an excellent site Pandora,it's rare to find realistic FM role play.
Would love to see Will in his next role as a cocky schoolboy or rugby player,sent to the headmistress to be taken down a peg or two,with the help of her cane!
Congratulation on a great site!!

Ooh, I like the rugby player idea, he certainly has the build for it. One day, when I could afford it, I'd love to shoot a changing rooms scene with a whole male sports team. Meanwhile a Headmistress scenario definitely sounds doable!
Thanks for your support, glad you're enjoying the scenes :)

Loved it
Posted by Ficwriterjet at 08:05 on 14 Dec 2013
I loved this one. Will being there while the girls are punished, and then getting punished himself made me happy. I especially liked that he only got six strokes while the girls both got twelve since he wasn't the instigator. I loved Caroline trying to get out of her punishment by saying that she'd learned her lesson just from seeing Amelia punished. I thought Amelia was the perfect mix of compliant and unhappy with a bit of defiance about what was going on.

I know what you mean, sometimes the presence of a boy in the same boat can make a /F scene so much enjoyable for me. It stops being about gender unfairness and lets me focus on the lovely, lovely spanking! But then, a lot of my fantasies are about exploring sexist situations, particularly institutional/cultural sexism in history. It's Complicated (TM).
Thanks for the lovely comment, I thought Caroline and Amelia gave great performances in this too. :)

A lovely film. I do agree with what you say about M and F punished together.
I was going to complain that Will should have been punished more severely than he was, and certainly that he should have been more stoical under his punishment than the young ladies were - but I see that you have in effect explained that, But certainly the footman should have been on his mettle to take his caning bravely....

The first mention of the sport “hockey” being played at Paarl Boys’ High School was in 1922 when it was stated, by the headmaster at the time Mr Du Préle Roux, that “… during the Winter Season some elected to forsake the manly game of Rugby and threw in their lot with the local flappers in a feeble imitation of the game of Hockey…”!

Sports Psychology: Confidence Part 1

Way We Work
At the Vision Consulting Group we believe you can only realise your dreams by understanding your current position in your specific market place. We will take time to understand your business, get to grips with the challenges you face and research your customers and competitors. In effect, we will become a virtual department in your company.
A clear and concise brief will be developed for your approval. Time spent on understanding and defining the problem and agreeing objectives is an invaluable stage in the process, and often overlooked.
Once agreed we will produce an interpretation and high level scope including our recommendations and costs for what we believe should be included in your marketing campaign or plan. The detail of this will clearly be defined by the scale of the project.
Following your discussion and approval we will then execute the agreed marketing plan managing the creative process and utilising our network of specialists where relevant. You will be updated on progress and a robust sign-off process will be followed in order to ensure all stakeholders are bought into the end result.
If you require us to work with your lead agency or approved suppliers, you will find us objective, constructive and dedicated.
If you want to realise the true potential of your business and need support in making your vision a reality contact us for an initial discussion.

We are a German directing duo, specialized in visual effects-intense commercials which we do not only direct but also lead their postproduction as visual effect supervisors. By that we can make sure our vision is created exactly as we had in mind and that the spots can reach the quality we commited to. Combining life action shots with computer generated digital effects is our main focus and has been our passion ever since in terms of filmmaking.
After we won the Young director's Award in Cannes in 2005 we´ve worked with numerous national and international agencies for various clients. In 2006 we have been selected for the 'Saatchi&Saatchi New Director's Showcase'.

DISCLAIMER | PRIVACY POLICY
We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of the Radical Production Method GmbH. The use of the Internet pages of the Radical Production Method GmbH is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.
The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the Radical Production Method GmbH. By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.
As the controller, the Radical Production Method GmbH has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.
1. Definitions
The data protection declaration of the Radical Production Method GmbH is based on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.
In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:
a) Personal data
Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
b) Data subject
Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is processed by the controller responsible for the processing.
c) Processing
Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.
d) Restriction of processing
Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.
e) Profiling
Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.
f) Pseudonymisation
Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.
g) Controller or controller responsible for the processing
Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.
h) Processor
Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.
i) Recipient
Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.
j) Third party
Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.
k) Consent
Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.

3. Cookies
The Internet pages of the Radical Production Method GmbH use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.
Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.
Through the use of cookies, the Radical Production Method GmbH can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.
By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website. The website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop. The online store remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.
The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable.
4. Collection of general data and information
The website of the Radical Production Method GmbH collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.
When using these general data and information, the Radical Production Method GmbH does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the Radical Production Method GmbH analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.
5. Routine erasure and blocking of personal data
The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to.
If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.
6. Rights of the data subject
a) Right of confirmation
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed. If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of confirmation, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.
b) Right of access
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller free information about his or her personal data stored at any time and a copy of this information. Furthermore, the European directives and regulations grant the data subject access to the following information:
the purposes of the processing;
the categories of personal data concerned;
the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations;
where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;
the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data, or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject, or to object to such processing;
the existence of the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source;
the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) of the GDPR and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.
Furthermore, the data subject shall have a right to obtain information as to whether personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation. Where this is the case, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.
If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of access, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.
c) Right to rectification
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.
If a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.
d) Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten)
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary:
The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.
The data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing.
The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR.
The personal data have been unlawfully processed.
The personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject.
The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1) of the GDPR.
If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to request the erasure of personal data stored by the Radical Production Method GmbH, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller. An employee of Radical Production Method GmbH shall promptly ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately.
Where the controller has made personal data public and is obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform other controllers processing the personal data that the data subject has requested erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data, as far as processing is not required. An employees of the Radical Production Method GmbH will arrange the necessary measures in individual cases.
e) Right of restriction of processing
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies:
The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data.
The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of their use instead.
The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.
If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of personal data stored by the Radical Production Method GmbH, he or she may at any time contact any employee of the controller. The employee of the Radical Production Method GmbH will arrange the restriction of the processing.
f) Right to data portability
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator, to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which was provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she shall have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided, as long as the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by automated means, as long as the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
Furthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject shall have the right to have personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
In order to assert the right to data portability, the data subject may at any time contact any employee of the Radical Production Method GmbH.
g) Right to object
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time, to processing of personal data concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions.
The Radical Production Method GmbH shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
If the Radical Production Method GmbH processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing. This applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. If the data subject objects to the Radical Production Method GmbH to the processing for direct marketing purposes, the Radical Production Method GmbH will no longer process the personal data for these purposes.
In addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her by the Radical Production Method GmbH for scientific or historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.
In order to exercise the right to object, the data subject may contact any employee of the Radical Production Method GmbH. In addition, the data subject is free in the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to use his or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications.
h) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her, or similarly significantly affects him or her, as long as the decision (1) is not is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the data subject's explicit consent.
If the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) it is based on the data subject's explicit consent, the Radical Production Method GmbH shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and contest the decision.
If the data subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated individual decision-making, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the Radical Production Method GmbH.
i) Right to withdraw data protection consent
Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to withdraw his or her consent to processing of his or her personal data at any time.
If the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the consent, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the Radical Production Method GmbH.
7. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Facebook
On this website, the controller has integrated components of the enterprise Facebook. Facebook is a social network.
A social network is a place for social meetings on the Internet, an online community, which usually allows users to communicate with each other and interact in a virtual space. A social network may serve as a platform for the exchange of opinions and experiences, or enable the Internet community to provide personal or business-related information. Facebook allows social network users to include the creation of private profiles, upload photos, and network through friend requests.
The operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, United States. If a person lives outside of the United States or Canada, the controller is the Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.
With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet website, which is operated by the controller and into which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-ins) was integrated, the web browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download display of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook through the Facebook component. An overview of all the Facebook Plug-ins may be accessed under https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/. During the course of this technical procedure, Facebook is made aware of what specific sub-site of our website was visited by the data subject.
If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook, Facebook detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site—which specific sub-site of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the Facebook component and associated with the respective Facebook account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Facebook buttons integrated into our website, e.g. the "Like" button, or if the data subject submits a comment, then Facebook matches this information with the personal Facebook user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.
Facebook always receives, through the Facebook component, information about a visit to our website by the data subject, whenever the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook during the time of the call-up to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the data subject clicks on the Facebook component or not. If such a transmission of information to Facebook is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their Facebook account before a call-up to our website is made.
The data protection guideline published by Facebook, which is available at https://facebook.com/about/privacy/, provides information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by Facebook. In addition, it is explained there what setting options Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the data subject. In addition, different configuration options are made available to allow the elimination of data transmission to Facebook. These applications may be used by the data subject to eliminate a data transmission to Facebook.
8. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google Analytics (with anonymization function)
On this website, the controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics (with the anonymizer function). Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed. Web analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.
The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, United States.
For the web analytics through Google Analytics the controller uses the application "_gat. _anonymizeIp". By means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is abridged by Google and anonymised when accessing our websites from a Member State of the European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website. Google uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for us.
Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The definition of cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google. During the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements.
The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject. With each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.
The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.
In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such. For this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and install it. This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google. If the information technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics. If the browser add-on was uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.
Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/ and under http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html. Google Analytics is further explained under the following Link https://www.google.com/analytics/.
9. Legal basis for the processing
Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).
10. The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party
Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.
11. Period for which the personal data will be stored
The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.
12. Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to provide such data
We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.
13. Existence of automated decision-making
As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.

150th Anniversary of Bream Summer Show
The Bream Summer Show 2015
The annual show 2015.
Bream Gardening Society was founded in 1865 to encourage, improve and extend the members’ knowledge of all branches of horticulture. Our Summer Show started in 1865 and since then has been held every year except 1929, the year of the General Strike, when there was great hardship in the Forest of Dean.
It even continued during the 1914-18 and 1939-45 wars. We were able to hold the show in wartime because until the 1960’s the Forest of Dean was an important mining area. Mining continued during the wars, so a good proportion of the local community were able, and were also very keen, to keep the Show running.
We held special events in 2015 to mark the Society’s 150th anniversary, and have researched the Society’s early years.
Special events held in 2015
June – Bream Open Gardens weekend, and Morris dancing in Bream
June Launch of Ian Hendy’s book “Unearthed” on the history of Bream Gardening Society.
July to September – Special display about the Society’s history at the Dean Heritage Centre
15th August – Summer Flower and Produce Show on Bream Rugby Field
24th October – Autumn Chrysanthemum and Craft Show
The Anniversary Quilt
See the story of the special anniversary quilt made for the 2015 150th show.
Banners for the Show Tent
In addition to the quilt and banner, members of the ‘Quilting Bee’ made individual banners showing flowers, vegetables, birds and butterflies to celebrate the joy of gardening using a variety of sewing techniques. The quilt, name banner, individual banners and bunting were used to decorate the main marquee for the 150th Show in August 2015.
An early show report
This report from the September 1868 Bream Parish Magazine makes interesting reading:
BREAM COTTAGE GARDENERS’ SOCIETY
The Fourth Annual Show was held at Colliers’ Beech, on Saturday, August 1st; and was, all things considered, better than any former one. The long drought had parched up the land, and consequently many gardens were unable to produce vegetables which were considered by their owners as worth entering for competition; hence there were only 157 articles this year against 193 last year. On the other hand the onions and potatoes were better, and the baskets and pots of flowers, and designs in grasses and flowers, more tasteful. The attendance was not so large as last year. The Lydney Volunteer Band played during the afternoon, and gave great satisfaction. At 6 o’clock the prizes, all of which were of a useful and substantial sort,—as quilts, sheets, fire-irons, tables, knives and forks, crockery, iron ware, tools, &c., many of them presents from Lady Campbell and Mrs. Noel,—were presented to the winners by Lady Campbell. The judges were the same as last year,— Mr. Collison from Clanna, and Mr. Moysey from Newland House. The following is the list of successful competitors:—
Ornamental Basket of Plants— 1st prize,George Webb; 2nd, George Summers; 3rd, W. Miles.

UK Bombardier staff 'relief' after trade ruling
January 26, 2018

0
Aircraft manufacturer Bombardier has won its case against plans for huge tariffs on its US imports which had put thousands of jobs at risk in Northern Ireland.
In a surprise decision, the US International Trade Commission (ITC) ruled in favour of Bombardier over American firm Boeing, which claimed its rival received unfair state subsidies from the UK and Canada.
The decision blocks US government proposals to slap 292% tariffs on Bombardier C-Series passenger planes, which risked thousands of jobs in Northern Ireland where the jets’ wings are made.
Bombardier, which employs more than 4,000 people in Belfast and contributes an estimated £400m to the Northern Ireland economy, said the C-Series jets were “critical” to its operations there.
Sky News’ Ireland Correspondent David Blevins said the ruling “lifts the cloud completely for the 1,000 employees who feared for their jobs”.
He added: “East Belfast – where the jobs were at risk – is a DUP constituency and the Prime Minister had raised this issue with President Trump on several occasions.”
The ruling comes after Theresa May met US president Donald Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday.
The Prime Minister said: “I welcome this decision, which is good news for British industry. Bombardier and its innovative workforce play a vital role in the Northern Ireland economy.”
In a statement, Bombardier said the ITC’s decision was a “victory for innovation, competition, and the rule of law”.

“The C-Series is the most innovative and efficient new aircraft in a generation,” it said.
“Its development and production represent thousands of jobs in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.”
Steve Turner, Unite assistant general secretary, said Bombardier workers in Northern Ireland would be “breathing a huge sigh of relief” after the ITC had “seen through Boeing’s baseless complaint”.
“There can be no backsliding from the US government on this decision,” he said.
More from BOEING
Airbus took a majority stake in Bombardier’s C-series passenger jet programme in October last year, which was hoped would help the jet programme overcome the tariff ruling.
Airbus boss Tom Enders said the company had offered to assemble some of the planes at its plant in Alabama for orders by American carriers.

Military Accident Claims
Grant Evatt is a former British Army Commando. He has specialised in military claims for almost two decades and he is a renowned expert in this complex area.
“I can’t recommend Grant highly enough. His knowledge and experience of military claims and passion for his client’s cause is second to none”
Chris Barnes, Counsel, Exchange Chambers
Military service is a rigorous occupation and training is designed to be tough enough to prepare our men and women to battle an enemy, but not to such a degree that they are exposed to perilous levels of danger. The MOD has a duty, like all conscientious employers, to provide a safe system of work, safe equipment, safe training and well-trained fellow soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. Any military personnel; Navy, Army, RAF, Royal Marines and Reserve Forces, who have sustained injury during their service as a result of negligence can bring a personal injury claim for their injuries and financial losses. Even the most moderate of injuries can put your career and all that you have trained so hard for in jeopardy.
Types of Military Claim:
Training – home and abroad including Salisbury Plain, Sennybridge, Otterburn, Dartmoor, the Middle East, Canada, Belize, Kenya
Friendly fire and negligent discharges
Inadequate/faulty equipment and machinery – weapons, vehicles, clothing…
Sports injuries – mountaineering, sub-aqua, skiing, rugby…
Climatic injuries such as Non-Freezing and Freezing Cold Injuries
Hearing loss – especially re-exposure to dangerous levels of noise, despite medical down-grading
Road traffic accidents
Harmful medication and exposure to dangerous substances
Fatalities
Bullying
Psychological injuries such as PTSD
Medical errors
The majority of military claimant’s approach us at a very late stage after being told that they cannot claim for their injuries nor can they make a claim, until they have been discharged. Indeed, many service personnel are still unaware they can bring a claim at all. You can and should be encouraged to do so, after all, you are just as entitled to claim as all other employees and, without some accountability, your accident and injuries will likely be repeated, and we can ill afford to keep injuring our brave men and women, needlessly.
You still have to prove your case and the MOD does not simply roll over and settle. They will put up a fight and you need to know just how to defeat them. You must instruct a specialist; Alma Law.
The Armed Forces Compensation Scheme – AFCS
The Armed Forces Compensation Scheme works as a no-fault in-service accident insurance policy. It is not compensation. The MOD calls it compensation because they don’t want you to talk to a lawyer. The scheme is administered by Veterans UK. They cannot advise you upon the merits or otherwise of your award because it is they who are making the award.
We can prepare your application and advise you upon whether, or not, the award offered to you is correct and give you your options if an application is refused, or the offer is too low.
You can bring a civil claim and an application for an AFCS award concurrently and we will almost always advise you to do so. If you instruct us to do both, our work and advice on the AFCS application is free. If we are instructed by you on the AFCS only, we may ask you to agree to pay us a fee for our work at the very end.
Grant Evatt
MD Alma Law
Grant served for 10 years with 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery where he was trained as an Arctic and Jungle Warfare specialist; military skiing instructor; artillery surveyor; parachutist; combat driver; combat medic; diver and Platoon Weapons Instructor. He is a top military claims specialist.

Grave Registration (2)
Grave Registration Reports (GRRs) are standard forms which detail graves for which the Commission is responsible within a particular burial ground. They provide basic details of the individuals, such as name, service number, rank, regiment, unit and date of death, and are listed in Plot, Row and Grave order.

DISCLAIMER:
This collection of documents was assembled by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and its predecessors as part of the processes involved in the commemoration of individuals. As a result, they contain many corrections and alterations which reflect their use as working documents. For further information concerning the history of the collection, please see our About Our Records page. Please be advised that some of the documents, especially the burial returns and exhumation reports, may contain information which some people may find distressing. The original archive records and their digital copies remain the property of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, but are available for re-use for private and non-commercial purposes.
Headstone (2)
These documents provide details of what was actually inscribed on an individual’s headstone. Their main purpose was to help manage the enormous programme of headstone production and engraving embarked on by the Commission.

All Aged Stakes: Le Romain primed to shine in Group 1 sprint at Royal Randwick
Matt JonesThe Daily Telegraph

News South Wales RacesSport
AS soon as Le Romain finished the TJ Smith Stakes a fortnight ago trainer Kris Lees knew he was back on track for Saturday’s $600,000 Group 1 All Aged Stakes (1400m) at Royal Randwick.
Le Romain, who was second in the race last year, finished seventh of 11 to In Her Time when first-up in the Group 1 The Galaxy (1100m) and even though it was well short of his best trip, Lees wanted to see more from him.

TURF QUEEN: WINX EQUALS CAREER-BEST RATING
It came a fortnight ago when second-up in the Group 1 TJ Smith Stakes (1200m) and back at his favourite track at day one of The Championships.
He was finishing hard behind star runners Trapeze Artist, Redzel and In Her Time and Lees was given the thumbs up by jockey Glyn Schofield.

“It was good to see him turn it around,” Lees said. “He was OK without being over-impressive in The Galaxy, which was way too short for him.
“I was really pleased with his TJ Smith run and this was the race we targeted with him.
“He’s got a terrific Randwick record and he’ll love the trip.”
Lees will also saddle-up another Group 1 winner, Clearly Innocent.
He has finished sixth three times this preparation but has been in a few races where the pace hasn’t suited and has ran behind Happy Clapper and the champion Winx in the Canterbury Stakes and George Ryder Stakes.
It’s by far the strongest form reference in Australia racing at the moment.
“He wasn’t that impressive in the George Ryder but that can happen when Winx is in the field,” Lees said. “He’ll get a bigger field with a more solid tempo, which will suit him. He just needs a bit of cut in the ground.
“You could make a few excuses for him this preparation and he raced against Winx and Happy Clapper who are the two benchmark horses in the country at the moment.”
Lees said Le Romain is his top pick but said Clearly Innocent was “more than capable” of causing an upset against the race favourite Trapeze Artist.
He’s coming off a scintillating TJ Smith Stakes win and 1400m is arguably his best trip.
“He’s a classy three-year-old who will get a weight advantage and he couldn’t have been more impressive in the TJ, so he’s the one to beat,” Lees said.
“There’s no real query on Le Romain but it’s looking like a stronger All Aged Stakes than last year and it’s always a good race.”
Brave Smash, Tom Melbourne, Hartnell and Endless Drama are some of the notable nominees.

The only survivor of an avalanche on Ben Nevis that killed three climbers yesterday has spoken from his hospital bed.
Mathieu Biselx and his three friends were on a route known as Number 5 Gully 3,000ft up the mountain when disaster struck.
The president of the Sion Swiss Alpine Club was airlifted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Glasgow after the incident.
Speaking to local Swiss newspaper Le Nouvelliste from intensive care, he said: “It’s terrible, they’re not here anymore. They will not see their family again.”
The 30-year-old said: “We were not very high and all of a sudden we heard a noise.
“We turned around and two seconds later, we were swept away by heavy, compact snow. I lost consciousness and when I woke up, only my head and one arm came out of the snow mass.”

The coastguard search and rescue helicopter is also on scene helping with the rescue efforts.
Mr Biselx, who is the father of a little girl, said that he had sustained serious injuries in the “terrible” incident.
He described his companions as “wonderful” people who were also fathers.
A former member of the club said: “This is the worst day of my life. Our sadness is boundless. It’s horrible. It should not happen to them.
“They were seasoned mountaineers. Really exemplary people. They had been doing the mountain for 20 years. They spent all their weekends there. They were almost professionals.”
Police have today said that the men killed in the incident were from Switzerland and France.
In a statement on their Twitter they said: “Two French men, aged 41 and 32, and a Swiss man, 43, died following the incident yesterday.”
Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team (MRT) said it received a call out from the Scottish Avalanche Information Service, which recorded a “large” avalanche at No 5 Gully at 11.45am.
The team, along with Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team, and around 29 volunteer mountain rescuers who happened to be training in the area, raced to the scene.
One of the climbers, who are said to have all been young men, died “pretty instantaneously”, while another could not be saved despite receiving CPR for half an hour, Donald Paterson, deputy team leader of Lochaber MRT, said.

A third climber died while being taken down the mountain.
Fort William Inspector, Isla Campbell, said: “Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those involved in the avalanche on Ben Nevis yesterday.
“Formal identification will take place in due course and the next of kin of those involved have now all been informed.
“I would again like to thank the volunteers from Lochaber and Glencoe mountain rescue teams and the members of the public who assisted with this incident, in what was extremely challenging conditions.”
Brian Tregaskis, Secretary of the Lochaber Mountain Rescue team said: “The members of the Lochaber and Glencoe Mountain Rescue teams did an incredible job in very difficult conditions.
“We’d like to extend our deepest sympathies to the loved ones of those who lost their lives and we hope the surviving casualty makes a full and speedy recovery.”
Police are encouraging hillwalkers to take precautions and plan their routes appropriately following yesterday’s tragedy.
Fort William Inspector, Isla Campbell, said: “The circumstances of yesterday’s incident remains under investigation however we want to take this opportunity to advise the public to carefully plan when heading to the mountain ranges.
“We do not want to put anyone off enjoying the great outdoors activities we have here in Scotland but we would ask that people plan their routes, take sensible precautions and consider whether it is safe to climb a particular route.
“The environment of the Scottish mountains is by its very nature an unpredictable one and it is important that people take as many precautions and plan ahead as much as possible if they are going to go climbing, especially at this time of year.
“Detailed information about weather conditions and avalanche risk are available from agencies including the Scottish Avalanche Information Service and we would encourage climbers to look at this information before heading out on the mountains.
“Be prepared to alter your routes or plans if there is indications that inclement weather or avalanches could affect your climb.”

File formats and sizes
Acceptable formats: .pdf, .cdr .eps or .ai.
Unusable artwork supplied will delay your order. Note that small text and/or small detail in the logo will not be accepted. Maximum file size limit is 5MB.
What is Vector artwork?
Vector artwork is a redraw file where your logo is created out of lines, shapes, curves and nodes which can be edited using graphic programs such as Corel draw. These files are editable in graphic programs and are essential to ensuring the best quality print.
Because vector-based images are not made up of a specific number of dots[pixels – such as jpegs bmps and Gif’s] they can be scaled to a larger size and not lose any image quality, they can also be edited and coloured to your needs.
What is converted to curves?
This specifically refers to text. When your file has text in it and is saved on one computer, when transferring the logo from one computer to another, that computer must have the same font file saved in order for that original text to be visible. If it does not, the computer will replace the original font with a different font that doesn’t look the same. Converting to curves takes the text and converts it into a graphic/image made up of lines. It is now no longer a font and cannot be edited. It can now be opened on any computer as it no longer sees it as a font and requires no font file.
Once converted to curves the text can no longer be edited by the typing tool it is an image made up of lines/outlines.
What size is your logo?
Use the controls on the right and enter either the width or height (in mm) for the logo.
Where should we brand
Use the drop down control on the right and select the location where we should brand your artwork.
Choosing print colours
Please not that artwork colours may look different on a real product than what you see on your computer monitor. Various factors influence the final apprearance of colours on a printed product regardless of calibrated monitors and colour profiles. Thus, colour accuracy can't be achieved 100%.

Pier chef returns hats, saying the heat is too much

CHEFS sweat blood and tears to attain three-hat status in The Good Food Guide.
Only six restaurants have the top ranking. Now, one of their number, Pier, is handing back its hats with chef/owner Greg Doyle, 55, saying: '' I don't want the intensity of it any more … that is, the level of attention to detail it requires, the constant development of new dishes, staffing levels and the cost of maintaining a three-hat restaurant.''
Unprecedented ... Greg Doyle of Pier. Credit:Edwina Pickles
Why you can't give your three hats back: Durack
The move is unprecedented in the 25-year history of the Sydney Morning Herald's Good Food Guide.

Pier at Rose Bay was opened by Mr Doyle in 1991 and quickly gained two-hat status, rising to the highest rank in 2007.
''We used to have a huge local clientele and that gradually dissipated as a three-hat restaurant because people felt they could not pop in for a quick meal,'' he said. ''People felt they needed to be going for an experience.''
From next month, the menu will be simplified, tables will be set when diners arrive and waiters will no longer wear gloves to change cutlery. But it won't become a bistro.
Main course prices, many currently $50-plus, will drop by about $10.
The change also comes after celebrated pastry chef Katrina Kanetani left Pier and executive chef Grant King is mooted to be looking for his own place.
Joanna Savill, co-editor of The Good Food Guide, said: ''There have been a couple of instances on my watch where some places - particularly those going from one hat to two - seem to go into a very different league and they have really felt the pressure of that once the Guide has come out.
''We have also had instances where customers have said that's not the two-hat experience I expected and the restaurant has, quite openly, said they were not expecting a two-hat status and were still chasing their tails to keep up with those expectations.''
The symbolic return of hats also has global predecessors.

Chef Alain Senderens returned his Michelin stars at Lucas Carton restaurant in Paris, as did British chef Marco Pierre White, while Joel Robuchon asked for two of his Paris restaurants to be excluded from the restaurant guide.
But Mr Doyle may find, like Mr Senderens, that it's not as simple as returning the hats. Michelin continued to list the Paris restaurant with stars and The Good Food Guide's Terry Durack said: ''As far as I'm concerned, as co-editor of the Guide, he can't [hand back the hats].''

10 miracles of survival in the wake of catastrophe
January 2, 2005 — 11.00am

Kanagaswary, 22, and her baby, of Uduththurai, northern Sri Lanka.
"I was saved by a mango tree after the tsunami hit my village. For five minutes I clung to one of the branches until my husband swam over to get me. It felt like such a long time. Even now, I don't know how I did it.
"I was nine months pregnant and my baby was due. I was determined to save the baby, so that's where I must have got my strength. It was so desperate, and the baby was mostly all I could think of.

"My mother and one of my younger sisters were not lucky. We buried them at 6pm that same day. It was about two hours before I started the labour pains. I gave birth to my little girl the next morning in hospital. Now, I am a sad and happy person."
Joyce Evans, 75, of Toorak, Melbourne, was holidaying in Sri Lanka.
"It was my first trip to Sri Lanka. We were in the south. There were 11 of us. We had travelled for a family reunion and rented this lovely villa. We'd had a fabulous Christmas, and the next morning we were sitting on the veranda having breakfast. The cook was making scrambled eggs and then all of a sudden we saw what looked like a wave surge into the garden. Suni, the cook, said to run.
"One of my grandchildren helped me. We were just ahead of the water. We came across a clump of bamboo trees on the way. I had to scramble up a tree to escape the water."
Nick and Kirsty Brady, of Sydney, were on the last leg of their round-the-world honeymoon and arrived in Phuket the night before the catastrophe.
Ms Brady said they were walking along Patong Beach towards the markets when they heard screams from a Thai woman. "The tide was quite far out and the shoreline started churning. I said to Nick, 'look at the water'. The wooden deckchairs started flying into the air. We turned and started running barefoot in dirty water through a soccer field.
"We climbed onto a fence and clung on while the water rushed in. When the first wave subsided we came down and headed back towards the beach to go to our hotel. But people started screaming at us to get back, because another wave was coming in.
"By now we were up to our waists in water. We climbed up on a wall, and held onto a concrete pylon, just 20 seconds before the second big wave crashed in, submerging us completely. A big four-wheel-drive that had been swept away narrowly missed us. We stayed there while the waves kept coming, then swam to higher ground, and ran up a mountain where we spent six hours, not knowing if another big wave was going to hit."
Richard and Rebecca Lea, of Sydney, were honeymooning in the Maldives and watched in horror as the swells approached Lohifushi Island.
"I was out surfing and had just caught a wave in," Mr Lea said.
"I was about 100 metres out when all of a sudden there was a massive surge and I just got carried across."
After catching the tidal wave whitewash to shore, the couple fled on foot to the centre of the island before making their way to Male.
"We were so lucky, our hut was OK, but the ones two or three down were just gone," Mr Lea said.
Michelle Pedemont and Cyril Chandler, of the Gold Coast, were holidaying in Phuket.
"I had gone to the gym at the Merlin Beach Resort in the morning so we were a bit late getting to the beach that morning and it saved my life," Ms Pedemont said. "We had finished breakfast and gone up to our room to take things to the beach when I looked out the deck and I saw this long white line of water rushing towards the beach."
"I knew straight away what it was," Mr Chandler said. "We stayed where we were and I saw it come straight over the beach and rush into the resort. We saw one couple on their bed thrown right through their window as the water hit the hotel."
"I thought we were going to die," Ms Pedemont said. "Cars were being thrown around like matchsticks. When the second wave hit we thought that was it, the building was going down. But what saved us was the water smashed all the glass windows and went straight through the building.
"After the water went down we got out the back of the resort and ran uphill as far as we could and stayed there for six hours until we thought it was safe.
"People said there was another wave coming. The resort was wiped out and if we had been down at the beach at our normal time we would have been among the dead."
Caroline Franklin and Peter Greenwood, of London, were holidaying on a remote island north of Phuket before flying to Melbourne.
"I was saved by a new Missoni orange Italian design swimsuit I had got especially for the trip," Ms Franklin said. "I was knocked unconscious as the wave picked me up and carried me off the beach but the strap snagged in the branches of a tree and when I came to I was hanging in this tree above the water."
Mr Greenwood screamed at her to get off the beach as he saw the wall of water coming. "She ran and I managed to grab her arm but the water tore us apart."
When the water stopped coming in, Ms Franklin untangled her swimsuit from the tree and climbed down. "The local people said the highest point on the island was a water tower and to make for that. I swam to the tower and climbed up. Ten people were there and many were badly injured."
Mr Greenwood struggled to the surface and clung to a tree. "I climbed up. I didn't know where Caroline was and only found her when I made it to the water tower.
Of 40 people on the island at least 11 are dead."
Ms Franklin said: "We lost everything. I don't even have the swimsuit any more as we used it as a sling for a woman with a broken arm."
Leanne Hammond, of Brisbane, and Jay Arrold, of Canberra, were holidaying in Phuket.
"I am the luckiest man in the world and I am going to buy lottery tickets galore when I get home," Mr Arrold said. "We had decided to go on a tour of the island that morning, otherwise we would have been on the beach and swept away. The ground floor of our hotel was completely washed away."
Ms Hammond said: "The tour couldn't go back to the hotel as the roads were blocked so we had to camp in the jungle. There were people on the tour who had relatives back at the hotel but all the telephone lines were down and we couldn't find out what was happening.
"There was a German father and two sons on our tour and they still don't know if the mother who stayed back with their little girl has survived."
Graeme Boze Cumming and Sharryn Magee, of Perth, were holidaying in Phuket.
"It's amazing the strength your body can get when you are really afraid of dying," Mr Cumming said. "We were caught in the water as it roared into our hotel. We were both in toilets when the water hit. I was in our room on the ground floor of the Horizon Beach Hotel at Patong Beach and Sharryn was using the ladies in the foyer. I saw water coming in under the door and thought this wasn't right. I opened the door and water just rushed in.
"I got into the courtyard of the hotel and I could see Sharryn clinging to a palm tree. I struggled over and I just pushed her up the tree and climbed behind her until we were close enough to reach over to the roof and we climbed up and sat there.
"Looking back I don't know how I did it. I couldn't climb that tree now or any other time."
Kristin Federow, of Brisbane, was taking a break in Phuket.
"I was lying on the beach when all the water suddenly went out to sea. It must have gone 400 metres at least. People ran out after it picking up fish. I thought there was something terribly wrong. Then I saw the white line of water racing in and I got up.
"I said to a woman who was lying near me to get up and run and we both did. I stopped and stood on the seawall, which is about 1 metres tall, to look back and I realised the wall wasn't going to stop the wave.
"[The water] was up to my waist, and I jumped on to a wall at a building site and I thought I was going to die. My time was up. I clung on and when the water started to go out I got down and ran uphill as I thought there was another wave coming."
The Ryan and Machin families, of Dalby, Queensland, were holidaying together in Phuket.
Doug Machin wandered down the hill to join his friend Garry Ryan on the beach where they saw the huge waves coming. "We turned and ran and shouted to get the kids and everyone out of bed. I yelled at them to get out and run uphill just before the water hit. It was right behind us as we all ran," said Mr Ryan.
"I have never run so fast in all my life than that first 70 metres to get back to the hotel to warn the kids. Five seconds flat I'd reckon." The children thought their fathers were joking, but could tell from their voices that it was serious.
Their families safe, the men returned to help others. "I saw a German lady swept by on an air mattress and she was in a bad way with her leg, so I jumped in to help her get to high ground," Mr Ryan said. "I saw another person trapped on the roof of a car and I went out to help her."

Noren leads by 1 at Scottish Open
San Martin - When Sung Hyun Park entered her first U.S. Women's Open, her goals were modest. Halfway through the tournament, Park has put herself in prime position to contend.
Park capitalized on the favourable morning scoring conditions, shooting a 6-under 72 Friday to take a two-stroke lead after the second round of the U.S. Women's Open at CordeValle.
"I didn't even think about winning because this is the first time for me," Park said through an interpreter. "I would like more experience with the USGA, LPGA. But I'm trying to enjoy this tournament. That's why I am just more comfortable, don't even think about the winning, I just enjoy the play."
Park, a 22-year-old from South Korea, made her LPGA debut last year when she finished second at the KEB-HanaBank Championship in South Korea. She has played three more LPGA tournaments this year, tying for sixth in her first major at the ANA Inspiration in the spring.
Park had four birdies in a six-hole span to move to 9 under before struggling on the final two holes. She hit her second shot into the greenside bunker at the par-4 17th and then missed a short par putt for her only bogey of the round. Park then drove into a hazard on the par-5 18th for a one-shot penalty before saving par with a 15-foot putt.
Amy Yang shot a 71 to get to 6 under, tied for second with first-round leader Mirim Lee. World No. 1 Lydia Ko bounced back from a 1-over par first round to shoot 66 for a tie for fourth with Haru Nomura.
Lee, who tied a U.S. Open record by shooting 8 under Thursday, birdied three of the final four holes on her front nine in the afternoon to take a one-shot lead over Park.
But things then quickly fell apart. She missed the fairway with her drive on the par-4 10th and her approach shot sailed past the green. Her chip attempt fell short of the green before she three-putted from the fringe for a double bogey.
Lee then drove into the front bunker on the par-3 12th hole before missing an 8-foot putt for par to fall two strokes off the lead.
"I kept trying to hit the fairway and the green, but I couldn't," she said. "So score, it's not bad, but not good, too."
Ko got off to a shaky start with a bogey on the first hole before stringing together four straight birdies starting at No. 3. She added two more birdies before capping her round with the seventh of the day at the par-5 18th.
"My birdie on 3 kind of turned the round around and making the string of birdies definitely helped," she said. "Just to know that this is the first time I was under par for the tournament kind of put myself in a positive position."
While contending in a major is a mostly new experience for Park, Ko is an old hat at it at the age of 19. She won the Evian Championship last September to become the youngest woman ever to win a major and followed that up with her second at the ANA Inspiration this year.
Ko then lost a playoff to Brooke Henderson in the KPMG Women's PGA Championship in Washington last month.
"I think the more I play, I think the more I get used to it, especially at these majors where the courses are tough," Ko said. "You need to stay patient. I think that's the big key I've been learning, just keep my head high and just enjoy it out here."
Henderson, ranked second in the world, and fourth-ranked Lexi Thompson could not match playing partner Ko and both finished the day at 3 over.
Among the players who missed the cut at 4 over were last year's winner In Gee Chun, 2014 U.S. Open champion Michelle Wie and 1998 winner Se Ri Pak.
Pak, whose success helped lead to the surge of South Koreans on the tour, double-bogeyed her final hole to finish with an 80 on the day and plus-9 in her final scheduled tournament in the United States.
Some players, including Karrie Webb and Christina Kim, came back to the 18th green to watch Pak's final shot and congratulate her on a remarkable career.

Sloan: Lost in Translation?
Posted on February 3, 2016 by Zeroto180	
Reply	
It’s an old story north of the border, and in fact, Zero to 180 would be legally barred from writing about Sloan in Canada due to their massive popularity. What would be the point?
Ah, but here in the States, Sloan is almost a dirty secret. What’s our stupid problem?
The “Canadian Sgt. Pepper’s”?
Sloan’s sophomore release, Twice Removed, would even be voted twice by Chart Magazine as (hold onto your hat) “The Greatest Canadian Album of All Time”! That’s right, ahead of Neil Young’s Harvest and Joni Mitchell’s Blue. At Sloan’s 2012 performance of their entire Twice Removed album, Zero to 180 would strike up a conversation with a fan from Up North and be struck by the young man’s bold declaration that this LP was revered (by more than a few) as a Canadian Sgt. Pepper of sorts.
And yet, the music venue hosting the show – DC’s Black Cat – was having none of it. Despite having previously played the club’s main stage to a full room, Black Cat made the dubious and disconcerting decision to squeeze the band and its fans check-to-jowl into its tiny “Backstage.” Oh, the indignity and blatant disrespect. Seriously though, Black Cat – what the funst?!?
Sloan in 2011 at DC’s Rock ‘n’ Roll Hotel (hourly rates available)
Twice Removed would be the band’s second release for David Geffen – yet another testament to Geffen’s savvy (DGC would also be home to Sonic Youth, Nirvana, The Posies, Teenage Fanclub, The Raincoats, Pere Ubu, John Doe, Aimee Mann, and Southern Culture on the Skids, while flagship label Geffen Records would bear witness to XTC, The Chameleons, Tommy Keene, The Misfits, Hole, The Simpsons … and er, the aforementioned Neil Young). Despite having invested $120,000 in the making of Twice Removed, Geffen would do little by way of promotion, and the band would soon find themselves dropped from the label. But hey, you can’t keep a good song down, and even this $2000 promo video for “People of the Sky” – filmed in the director’s backyard – does nothing to diminish the song’s oversized appeal:
“People of the Sky” Sloan 1994
“People of the Sky” would hit the #58 spot on the Canadian chart in late 1994.
Pop Matters makes a credible case for Sloan as Canada’s Beatle-ian counterparts — before you snort derisively, however, please allow Aaron Pinto to count the ways:
1. The band’s lineup never changed after its first album was released.
2. Each member was indispensable and irreplaceable.
3. Each member had a distinct, unique personality.
4. Each member could sing.
5. Each member could write. (In the case of the Beatles, three did regularly.)
6. Every album is essential and different from the one before it.
7. There are enough albums to constitute a complete career, but not so many that it’s a burdensome task to listen to and keep track of them all.
8. They were a tremendous live band.
9. They cared about their band image—every album except one features each member’s likeness on the cover.
10. The band always possessed a sense of humor, be it in its lyrics or its public interactions.
11. They broke up instead of continuing and potentially tainting their band legacy with a lineup change or a bad album.
Mr. Pinto disturbingly writes about the band in the past tense, though the band’s website gives no formal indication (will try not to read too much into the statement “no shows booked at the moment”). Has Sloan officially disbanded?!
Hey, did you know that Zero to 180 has a Facebook page where you can go and “like” stories that have earned a place in your heart? It’s true. Zero to 180 is channeling the spirit of Sally Field as it earnestly asks you to like it – papa bear could use some sugar.

Kokoda Wallaby
Kokoda Wallaby: Stan Bisset—the rugby international who became a Kokoda hero
Stan Bisset was a real hero, both in battle, on the rugby pitch and in desperate armed combat against the Japanese during the Second World War. As a member of the ill-fated 1939 Wallaby touring team to England, he was a rugby legend. In the Middle East and on the Kokoda Track, he was one of Australia's most distinguished and heroic combatants. But above all else, he personified so many attributes of the Australian soldier: moral and physical courage, compassion, selflessness, independence, loyalty, resourcefulness, devotion and humour. Stan Bisset's remarkable life story is told by former Australian soldier and Afghanistan veteran Andrew James. This is a truly inspiring book that crosses generations.
To purchase the book contact the publisher.

Nevada Arts & Artists – July
Nevada Traveler
by Dana Nollsch
There is an elephant in the northern Nevada room, and its name is Artown.
July is truly a special month in Reno, about 500 Artown events over 31 days, so let’s dive right in!
I have looked at every event and read each event description; in a word “overwhelming”. So if you pick out a few interesting events over the 31 days will it seem more doable?
Here is my take on opening weekend.
Downtown Reno will be abuzz with CIRCUS CIRCUS 24-HOUR MURAL MARATHON, RENO ART FEST, CONTROLLED BURN PRESENTS: FIRE FEST, BASS CAMP IN THE PARK, SUNDAY MUSIC BRUNCH AT THE MUSEUM, OPENING NIGHT: BANDALOOP, OPENING NIGHT: LOS LOBOS all within walking distance of each other.
That’s a lot, but let’s take a closer look at just one of the weekend events.
T
The Circus Circus 24-hour Mural marathon is an event that I like to visit several times during the weekend to see the progress. Here is the video I made two years ago — It is fascinating to see the progression of the works over the 24 hours. These artists take their work very seriously and the fact that these 24-hour works will be up for the next year is important to the Reno art community.
The month-long event at the Wilbur D. May Center, Dragon Lights is a spectacular event in the arboretum with Chinese dragons, elephants, tigers, pandas, and many more figures represented by detailed fabric sculptures lit up creating a magical stroll through the park. Along with the sculptures there is a show featuring traditional Chinese Dancing. Tickets are $17 adults; $12 children.
The Headliner series at the Robert Z. Hawkins Amphitheater features musical performances every Thursday evening. Anat Cohen, Blind Boys of Alabama with Paul Thorn, Jake Shimabukuro, and Deve Mahal, are the performers that make up the lineup for this year.
The Monday night music series performers take the stage at Robert Z. Hawkins Amphitheater as well, and that line up is; We Banjo 3, Hot Club of San Francisco, Tumbledown House, Bria Skonberg, and Marcia Ball.
This is just a small sampling of what will be happening in Artown in July. Whatever you want to explore in the arts, Music, Visual, Crafts, and more there will be something for you, just take a few moments and check out Artown’s events calendar.
A New Mural for Eureka
Antone Damele is painting Jimmy Ithurralde’s dad, Basque Sheepman James “Tou Toun” Ithurralde. Jimmy approached the Eureka Restoration Enterprise and asked their help in realize his vision. It’s at 180 Main Street
This great Event is lovingly put on by a handful of very dedicated people. Working with them this year I have seen firsthand what it takes to put on an event of this magnitude.
There is a comprehensive list of events in a Little Book that can be found just about everywhere in the Reno area and this list is also online in the Artown Calendar on the Artown website: https://renoisartown.com/
If you are looking for a historic backdrop for the Fourth of July Fireworks check out Virginia City this year. The celebration starts at noon on Wednesday, July 4, with a parade and the fireworks after dark. Throughout the day there will be food, music, the V&T Railroad, and much more Virginia City fun.
Get out and enjoy the summer nights.

Tuscarora – Correspondence – December 2015
Donald Dickerson
Tuscarora
The Tuscarora Ladies Club
Making apple and pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving and Christmas is the Tuscarora Ladies Club biggest fundraiser. A couple of Saturdays before Thanksgiving, club members convened at Society Hall, our community center, to peel and chop eighty pounds of Granny Smith apples, roll out pie dough and prep pies for the freezer. The club takes orders from folks in the valley and also delivers to Elko, even in a snowstorm.
There’s an old-fashioned scrapbook in Society Hall filled with newspaper clippings from the Elko Daily Free Press about the club’s origin: “On October 12, 1943 the ladies of Tuscarora and Independence Valley met at the home of Mrs. Stanley Ellison at the Spanish Ranch to form a Community Club.” World War II influenced their initial activities: “For Christmas of 1944 the club packed eight boxes … of candies, cookies, an afghan crocheted by the members, slippers, magazines and books … and sent to eight soldier boys in the Bushnell Hospital at Brigham City, Utah.”
The Tuscarora Homemakers were good old-fashioned ranch cooks and produced two cookbooks, in 1965 and 1983. For anyone with hunters in the family, here’s a classic recipe for mincemeat from the 1983 cookbook:
MOTHER OLDHAM’S MINCEMEAT
(Made when she lived at the Dinner Station, about 1905)
— Della Phillips
10 c cooked, chopped meat
12 c apple cider
6 c chopped suet
2 T ground allspice
10 c. peeled and chopped apples
2 T cinnamon
4 c finely chopped citron
2 T cloves
6 c raisins
2 T salt
4 c currants
2 c brandy
10 c brown sugar
juice of 4 lemons
Cook meat until tender; let stand in juice all night. Take off all fat and any gristle. Grind with large knife of grinder (or food processor chopping blade). Skin suet well; grind with small knife. Peel and core apples; grind with large knife. Warm lemons to get all juice. Mix all together, using hands. Be sure to mix very well. Put in 5 gallon crock and cover with thin cloth; keep in a very cool place. This recipe can be halved successfully. It is better after it sets for a week or so. It will keep for months in a cool place.
Renamed and revived in June of 2013, the Tuscarora Ladies Club carries on the tradition of community service and socializing.
— Nancy Harris McLelland

About Barca Dallas
Barca Dallas was founded July of 2009 by David Goude and Roger Rovira. After winning the treble we were a bit disappointed that we didn’t have enough Culés to share in our excitement. So, we set out to change that, currently, Barca Dallas is one of the largest Penya’s (aka, Fan Club) in the world. As of August 2017, we have nearly 1,400 active members in our club. Each week we meet at the Rugby House Pub in Plano, TX to watch the games together. We love Barça and it is a big part of our lives. We welcome anyone of all ages to join us each week at the Rugby House and to become an official member of our club…Visca Barça!!!

Joe Schmidt – “The One Thing I Would Say Is Don’t Give Up On This Team”
by Jason Hennessy · March 16, 2019
They’ll be back.
Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt says he’s “disappointed” with the manner of Ireland’s 25-7 defeat to Wales in the Six Nations today but has asked for Ireland to not “give up on this team” just yet.
Schmidt highlighted Ireland’s uncharacteristic poor discipline and Wale’s early try, but conceded that they simply “weren’t as good as Wales today.”
“I’m disappointed” Schmidt said when asked about the manner of Ireland’s defeat.
“Our discipline which usually doesn’t let us down it allowed them to get the distance ahead of us.”
“They scored after a couple of minutes and you’re always under a little pressure and we didn’t respond overly well to that pressure, giving up penalties.”
“I thought we were pretty unlucky not to get a couple of our own,”
“But when you don’t get that you’ve gotta earn something elsewhere and we weren’t as good as Wales today.”
It’s been a Six Nations to forget for Ireland but Schmidt says the current crop will be “gracious in defeat” and take today’s defeat ”on the chin.”
“The one thing I would say is don’t give up on this team.” Schmidt added
“They’re a hard-working and skilful bunch who will take this on the chin. They’ll be gracious in defeat because Wales did a super job. ”

Hockey: Oranje Meisies win DSG U14 Tournament
Print
Email
Fourteen of the best U14 Girls Hockey teams in the country assembled in Grahamstown this past weekend (10-12 August) to compete in the DSG Invitational Tournament.
This is the second year that the Diocesan School for Girls have hosted this tournament for the U14’s and how the event has grown was evident in the huge support given by parents who travelled from all parts of the country to witnesses some high class hockey.
From the opening match it was clear that Oranje Meisies, who are arguably one of the powerhouses in school hockey, were going to be a very difficult team to beat. Brushing aside a strong St Cyprian side and then the hosts 4-1 on the first morning of play helped to boost the confidence of the Bloemfontein side who went on to record win after win for the remainder of the tournament. Tuane van der Westhuizen in particular was impressive for Oranje as she worked herself in position and found the back of the net with habitual precision.
The surprise package at the tournament was St. Cyprians who bravely took on some of the big names and invariably came away with the victory. The tenacity of the Cape Town school which was borne out in how they held their collective nerve in their semi-final penalty shootout win over St.Mary’s Waverley, and they earned the right of face Oranje Meisies in the final match.
Oranje however showed their class to win the final match over the gutsy St.Cyprians with a narrow 1-0 victory.
Scoring a record 28 goals in the tournament they were by far the stand out team of the tournament and defensively they only conceded 2 goals which underline their overall dominance.
Already the DSG U14 Tournament is regarded as one of the premier U14 hockey event in the country and there are plans that 16 teams will be invited to participate in 2019.
Prize winners at this years event were:
York High School – Fair Play Trophy
Best Striker and Player of the Tournament – Tuane van der Westhuizen (OranjeMeisies)
Best Midfielder – Kristin Leonard (St Mary’s Waverley)
Best Defender – Tamryn Louw (Woodridge College)
Best Goalkeeper – Shannon Wylde (Pearson)
Final placings for 2018
1st OranjeMeisies
2nd St Cyprians
3rd St Mary’s Waverley
4th Woodridge College
5th Clarendon and Collegiate (final match drawn)
7th Bloemhof and Pearson (final match drawn)
9th Springfield
10th DSG
11th Somerset College
12th Oakhill
13th York High School

Barrhead band tastes success at Scottish champs
Photo courtesy of the Scottish Brass Band Association
BRASS players from Barrhead Burgh Band were on a high at the weekend after tasting victory at a prestigious competition.
The talented musicians won their section at the Scottish Brass Band Championships, staged at Perth Concert Hall.
They were playing in the fourth section of competition, the bottom tier, but will now be promoted to the third section after taking the title.
Flugelhorn player Fiona Kennedy was also rewarded for her efforts, winning the Best Instrumentalist award in the section.
Conductor Alistair Gibson, who started directing Barrhead Burgh Band last September, said: “They have worked incredibly hard in the short time I have been conducting them.”
The band’s success means they will compete in the National Brass Band Championships in Cheltenham in September, in the hope of clinching the UK fourth section title.
Mr Gibson added: “They worked their socks off for this contest and have done themselves and Barrhead proud.
“We look forward to the rest of the year, including the national finals in Cheltenham.”
To find out more about the band, visit their Facebook page.

Bulls Box Clever
BullBuilder and Bulls Foundation have teamed up to provide smart new boxing equipment for use by the Academy and Scholarship players at the Tong Training Centre. Other equipment bought included gloves and pads. The equipment was sourced by the Bulls Foundation and funded by BullBuilder, the Supporters Trust. BullBuilder chairman Sam Grundy explained. “Bulls Head of Youth Development John Bastian explained that there was a need for boxing equipment to aid player development and ourselves at BullBuilder and Mark Winder at the Bulls Foundation stepped in to help. The Foundation have great links into the community and were able to source excellent, top-quality equipment. We then used our member subscriptions to pay for it.” Bulls head of youth John Bastian explained how the equipment would benefit the Academy and Scholarship players. “Boxing training is something rugby league players have done for many years now and having this equipment in house means we can do that whenever we want. Boxing training helps not only with fitness but also with coordination and movement. Boxing requires concentration and precision, often at high intensity with explosive movements and in that way is good for simulating similar things to what players experience on the field. You have to get your feet in the right position before you punch – as in a tackle and often do that when fatigued.” “The heavy bags and pads are great for these purposes and will be a great aid to our youth players and first teamers. It provides some variety to training and can be really beneficial when the weather makes outdoor training impossible. I’d like to thank BullBuilder and the Bulls Foundation for their assistance in providing this equipment and would urge supporters to get involved with BullBuilder if they want to provide further help.” To join BullBuilder visit our website at http://www.bullbuilder.co.uk/join/, or contact us at Bradford Rugby League Supporters Society Ltd, Suite 2 Buttershaw Works, Buttershaw Lane, Bradford, BD6 2DD.

OPINION: Past, Present, & Future of FSU’s student newspaper in wake of free speech controversies
Proper governance of The Collegian can lead to improved management and financial stability.

The Collegian has done a great job of reporting on Fresno State’s recent free speech controversies.
The Collegian is now in a good spot to come to grips with its own free speech controversy: The Hitler editorial.
At issue is the concept of checks and balances.
The Collegian is Fresno State’s student-run, full service media platform. I am The Collegian’s editorial faculty adviser. The Collegian is an award-winning operation. The student journalists do all of the hard work. They deserve all of the credit.
What follows is my personal opinion.
Let’s begin with some context. That, of course, means Randa Jarrar.
Jarrar is the Fresno State English professor who recently stirred up a nationwide storm with her Twitter comments on the death of former First Lady Barbara Bush. I didn’t see the tweets. I understand from media reports that Jarrar called Mrs. Bush a “witch.” I understand that Jarrar said she’s “happy” that Mrs. Bush is dead.
These and other comments sent the dominos falling in a predictable pattern. Fresno State officials said they would look into the matter. Jarrar supporters said she has a First Amendment right to speak her mind. The media explored every angle.
The Jarrar controversy came in the wake of the Greg Thatcher and Lars Maischak controversies. Thatcher is the Fresno State public health professor who was sued by students last year after he was caught on camera defacing pro-life messages written in chalk on university sidewalks. Maischak is the Fresno State history lecturer who, in early 2017, tweeted that “Trump must hang” in order to save democracy.
The Thatcher and Maischak incidents also generated national heartburn.
Editor-In-Chief Cresencio Rodriguez-Delgado and the rest of The Collegian’s editorial board had a good analysis of the situation in the paper’s April 23 edition.
“We’ve been here before, and we will likely come back to the same place in the future,” The Collegian wrote. “We can predict that another professor administrator or even a student will soon face the wrath of online attacks for what they may say or do if it offends political junkies on either side of the spectrum.”
The Collegian had sound advice for a nation besotted with social media: Feel free to give your two cents, but “don’t do it in a place where your thoughts are limited to 280 characters.”
The three faculty members faced little or no official pushback. Maischak was transferred from classroom duties to online instruction. Thatcher settled the lawsuit.
And Fresno State President Dr. Joseph Castro on Tuesday said Jarrar would face no disciplinary action. She had violated no university or California State University policies.
Let’s stipulate that we all embrace the First Amendment: “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press;….”
With that said, I suggest that Americans hate more than anything else to be on the receiving end of arbitrary power, whether it comes from a monarch or a mob. I think that’s what most angered people about Jarrar’s comments. She tweeted about her status as a tenured professor. She made a point of piggybacking on the excellent and hard-earned brand name of Fresno State. She smugly ridiculed a gallant and patriotic woman and her family. Then she sat back and dared America to do anything about it.
But the glory of our democracy is that legitimate accountability doesn’t begin and end with official sanction. Informal but perfectly legal checks and balances on personal behavior in the public square are valid.
For example, I wonder if the most effective restraint on outlandish behavior by some Fresno State professors might come from the Fresno State faculty itself. Jarrar, Maischak and Thatcher suggest there’s been a leveling of professionalism among the Fresno State professoriate.
That brings me to the Hitler editorial.
Here, too, I’m talking about the First Amendment and the exercise of arbitrary power. I’m going to propose that the university would be wise to initiate – or, to be more precise, reinvigorate – an official system of checks and balances on the source of that Page 1 opinion piece: The Collegian.
Do you remember the Hitler editorial?
The Collegian of Feb. 22, 2016 hit the campus newsstands in the morning. Page 1 featured a full-page photo of Donald Trump, then in the middle of his campaign to secure the Republican presidential nomination. Trump is wearing a business suit. Behind him are two American flags.
“Sieg Heil!” said the headline. The sub headline said: “Living Nazi Germany in Trump’s America.”
The editorial on Page 2 began: “Trump’s America is the Fourth Reich.”
The fourth paragraph said: “The hardcore racist and fascist people supporting Trump don’t want to kick out Muslims and undocumented Mexicans – they want to murder them.”
The editorial’s 23rd and final paragraph said: “Heil Trump!”
The other paragraphs are of the same vein.
The editorial includes a photo illustration of Trump in a Nazi-like brown suit and giving the Nazi stiff-arm salute with the White House in the background.
The editorial attracted national attention. Freedom of the press was on many lips.
Trump on Jan. 20, 2017 was sworn in as the nation’s 45th president.
Many Fresnans in the wake of the Hitler editorial tried to figure out what had happened in The Collegian office during the hours leading up to the editorial’s publication. What was the process by which such an editorial got in the paper? I was among those Fresnans with questions; I didn’t join The Collegian team until August 2016.
Bee education reporter Mackenzie Mays on Feb. 23, 2016 published an article on controversy.
Mays quoted from a second-day Collegian editorial that elaborated on the staff’s authority to run the Hitler editorial: “It is important to stress that The Collegian, a student-run publication, isn’t subject to prior review. No faculty or staff members read the article before it was published – as it should be.”
Mays quoted from a university press release: “The newspaper is a learning laboratory for students who aspire to media careers. It provides them the opportunity to learn about the role of the free press and practice at writing a wide range of material, including news stories, features and editorials.”
Mays quoted Dr. Katherine Adams (my boss), chair of what was then called the Mass Communications and Journalism Department and is now the Media, Communications and Journalism Department: “Most people don’t understand that The Collegian is not the voice of Fresno State. It’s a classroom where students learn the business. They are not edited to be told what to say and are not obligated to show it to us at all.”
Five sentences from those statements deserve another look.
1.) The Collegian “isn’t subject to prior review.” Not true. Every newspaper worth its salt is subjected to intensive “prior review” before the pages are sent to the pressroom. The review comes from layers of editors – executive editor, managing editor, city editor, assistant city editor, section editors. They are acting as agents for the newspaper’s sovereign authority. At newspapers owned by publicly traded companies, that authority is corporate management at the hands-on level and shareholders at the top level. The reason for this layered system: People wielding power in the public arena need checks and balances because no one is perfect. The system of in-house prior review at The Collegian isn’t as elaborate as the system at The Bee when I worked there. But it exists.
2.) “Most people don’t understand that The Collegian is not the voice of Fresno State.” Not true. Fresno State is a collaborative venture involving 25,000 students and 5,000 faculty and staff. All are voices of Fresno State. Everything they do that’s connected to the university is part of the Fresno State voice and reflects on Fresno State. That’s why the Athletic Department works so hard to nurture civic virtue in its student-athletes. The Collegian isn’t the voice of Fresno State. But The Collegian is a voice of the university, and a very powerful one.
3.) “The newspaper is a learning laboratory for students who aspire to media careers.” A newspaper without a system of high standards and public obligations is not a learning laboratory. It’s a rugby ruck.
4.) “They are not edited to be told what to say and are not obligated to show it to us at all.” Unfettered will in any group, including journalists, is a recipe for disaster.
5.) “No faculty or staff members read the article before it was published – as it should be.” This is the big one. As this statement implies, something strange happened at The Collegian office in the late evening of Feb. 21 and the early morning of Feb. 22, 2016.
A newspaper newsroom’s daily operation begins with a news budget. This is a list of stories to be published in the next day’s paper. The budget is flexible – it adjusts to breaking news.
The newsroom system of checks and balances collapses without a budget held in the highest regard by all who are part of that system. Trust is destroyed if someone in the hierarchy (even at the top) decides he can overturn the budget without first going through accepted procedures for making such a change.
The Collegian during my four semesters as editorial faculty adviser has always based its production system on a comprehensive news budget. What this means in practice is that Rich Marshall, The Collegian’s general manager and my colleague at The Bee for many years, and I know what’s on each edition’s news budget. We edit each story for style and content. Collegian staffers aren’t required to accept our edits. On the other hand, Rich Marshall is an accomplished journalist with decades of experience. Journalism is a hard trade with a lifelong learning curve. The Collegian’s young staffers would be wise to take his advice.
I was not in The Collegian office on the production night of Feb. 21-22, 2016. But I’ve talked to some people who were in the office at various times on that night. Their statements and the statement in No. 5 above point to a betrayal of best newsroom practices.
It appears that Marshall and Dr. Bradley Hart, the editorial faculty adviser at the time, were led to believe by someone on The Collegian staff that the next day’s paper would contain only the stories listed on the news budget. It appears that when Marshall and Hart had finished editing those stories and left for the night, someone on The Collegian staff brought out the Hitler editorial (hardly a breaking story) and inserted it on Page 2. It appears that someone then made sure that Page 1 was redesigned.
To repeat: The second-day Collegian editorial of Feb. 23, 2016 said, “No faculty or staff members read the article before it was published – as it should be.”
I suggest that such a statement is an admission that someone on The Collegian sucker-punched the system and expected to face no accountability for the deception. (Let me emphasize that current Editor-in-Chief Rodriguez-Delgado and his team were not part of the events of Feb. 21-22, 2016. I must add that several current Collegian staffers have told me that the paper continues to suffer public fallout from the Hitler editorial.)
Usually, I’d suggest that this betrayal was regrettable but not of long-term consequence. Newspapers and the First Amendment can handle less than professional behavior. And student journalists have considerable protections in state law.
But The Collegian can’t mandate taxation without representation. And that’s where Hitler editorial could have far-reaching consequences.
The Collegian faces a financial crisis. This isn’t the first time in its 96-year history that the paper has been threatened by red ink. But this threat may be the most serious of all. The digital world is destroying the old business model.
What makes The Collegian different from newspapers in the legacy media is taxes. Mainstream newspapers depend largely on advertising for their financial survival. The Collegian depends largely on a mandatory student fee.
The Collegian in the 2017-18 school year is estimated to have income of roughly $360,000. This school year’s estimated expenses are roughly $400,000. The $40,000 gap comes on top of several years of money woes. Labor costs (i.e. minimum wage) are going up. Advertising revenues are flat or declining. The Collegian’s reserve is disappearing.
The Collegian has done a superb job of reporting on these pressures and the possible solutions.
However, The Collegian is blessed to have access to a guaranteed source of money that has nothing to do with advertising. Each Fresno State student pays a fee of $5.50 per semester earmarked specifically for The Collegian. This fee is essentially a mandatory tax. The fee is expected to generate about $270,000 in the current school year.
Bottom line: Roughly 75% of The Collegian’s annual income comes from this mandatory student tax. I know of a lot of mainstream newspapers that would love to have 75% of their expected annual income generated by a tax for which they don’t have to lift a finger.
The Collegian fee was approved by students some years back in a referendum. My point isn’t to review the wisdom of the fee (my salary comes from The Collegian budget, which means student taxes fund about 75% of my gross pay; I am grateful for the fee). My point is to suggest that the existence of the student fee means The Collegian’s constitutional right to a free press belongs to the Fresno State student body paying the vast majority of the newspaper’s operational tab, not to The Collegian’s editorial staff.
The Collegian staff, myself included, is simply the agent for a student body that owns the newspaper. But how does a student body of 25,000 make its will known at the operational level?
I return to The Collegian’s financial crisis and its connection to the Hitler editorial.
Many dedicated and talented professors, administrators and student leaders are working on solutions to The Collegian’s money challenges. Because of this effort, the spotlight has returned to The Collegian’s governing board. To my knowledge, the board has not met in my two years with the paper. Colleagues with longer years of service tell me they can’t remember the last time the board met with a full agenda and serious intentions of fulfilling its duties.
The Collegian governing board has an enabling document describing the board’s authority and limitations. The board consists of university officials and students. The fact that “governing” is part of the board’s name is a clear sign that officials back when The Collegian fee was approved recognized that there had to be some type of democratic mechanism that enables The Collegian’s sovereign authority – Fresno State’s ever-changing student body – to have an effective, consistent and legitimized way of influencing the direction of its investment while also giving The Collegian staff enough breathing room to do its job.
Marshall in his capacity as Collegian general manager has made heroic efforts to reenergize the governing board. Common sense says any dramatic changes to The Collegian’s business model would have to eventually go before the board at a public hearing. But I hear through the grapevine that administrative inertia and dwindling time (the Spring semester ends in a few weeks) have conspired to leave the governing board in deep hibernation.
I am suggesting here that an active Collegian governing board, or a some other panel representative of the tax-paying student body and the university administration, is the best way to ensure that future controversies such as the Hitler editorial (and they will surely come – journalists are as human as angry professors) fit into a framework of constitutional checks and balances.
Such a board would ensure that The Collegian’s owner, the students, has a formal public forum for getting to the bottom of things. Such a board at its monthly meeting might explore whether stories about the baseball team are too often placed below the fold. Such a board might get periodic updates on The Collegian’s finances. And such a board at some point in the distant future might dig into whether a Collegian editor is using his power over this public trust to advance his personal agenda to the detriment of the student body’s greater good.
This would not restrain free speech. This would make power accountable to student taxpayers.
If we at The Collegian don’t like accountability and transparency, we should give the money back.

George, the Hitler editorial isn’t the first instance something the Collegian printed created controversy on or off campus. I recall when the editor ran an opinion piece firmly putting the Dean of Students in his place after the dean tried to force the paper to stop taking ads from beer companies. The piece said the paper would stop taking beer ads when the university did something about Jim Sweeney and his drinking. Athletics had hysterics and threatened to pull the paper’s credentials. I was harassed by sports information staff (I was paid sports staff at the time). The same semester, we had the layouts of one issue and the entire press run of another stolen after we ran articles critical of the Greek system.
I won’t go into the often stormy relationship between the paper and Associated Students. The current management mess called the Governing Board is the result of a shotgun marriage forced on the Media, Communication and Journalism department after ASI washed its hands of the paper back when. Hindsight being 20/20, it’s unfortunate MCJ demanded that it divest itself of the paper after the minority editions were created nearly 50 years ago. When the decision was made some years ago to shut Insight down and bring the Collegian back under the MCJ umbrella, it was doomed to fail eventually.
You keep harping on the taxation without representation theme. All student approved fees are set up that way. Unless students vote to modify or rescind it (and ASI Senate would have to agree to put such a measure on the ballot), the fee will go on being collected.

Thank you Mr. Hostetter for a voice of reason. When faculty behaves like petulant 13-year olds and, surprise, is mimicked by students in the very public forum of a newspaper – it’s good to know there is some accountability in place. I’d like to see Fresno State produce real journalist, not self-righteous social warriors who can type.

it is brave, that you were willing to be gently critical of your bosses quotes, before your tenure. Bottom line is. George. The reason, why the community is up in arms and angry is because fresno st operates (ideologically like a one party state). 90 percent or more of prof’s range from moderate liberal to (many) socialist. Will you bring up to the faculty senate a proposal for ideological diversity and affirmative action to move (gradually) toward a university where the prof’s political viewpoint is somewhere fairly close to the central valleys population? It that was achieved people would care less about the prof jarrar’s of the world

More Info
Pilates is a movement system developed over 70 years ago. Originally referred to as ‘the art of control’, it emphasises precise, concentrated and flowing body movements all designed to improve toning and flexibility – but not to add bulk.
Dynamic Pilates is one of New Zealand’s largest equipped pilates studios. We are also a pilates teacher training studio.
Based in city-end Karori, Wellington, Dynamic Pilates is led by Chantal O’Connor, a fully accredited Master of pilates with 18 years’ classical pilates instruction experience.
At Dynamic Pilates, we practice classical pilates. Movements are fluid and at a pace, giving you a real workout as you transition from movement to movement.
The benefits of pilates are: strengthening, lengthening, toning, flexibility, posture and balance, injury prevention, rehabilitation, and post natal recovery.
Starting at Dynamic Pilates
Dynamic Pilates offers a broad range of group, semi-private and one-on-one classes in:
• Classical pilates (mat, reformer, tower and chair)
• Core, strength and stretch
• Dynamic stretch
• Cross training
• Personal training
We have a dedicate mat class for seniors (over age 60 years) at reduced pricing.
There is no membership fee. Clients can pay per class (casual rate), or buy 12 or 24 trip tickets which are valid for 12 months from date of purchase.
We work with you individually to suit your lifestyle and needs - regardless of your level of fitness, age, lifestyle, and existing or aged injury status.
Chantal is also an experienced pilates teacher trainer. There is a global shortage of pilates teachers. If you would like flexible, certain work which benefits others, see our "Teacher Training" page for more information and get in contact with us :)
Who does pilates?
Our clients are a broad cross section of the community: professionals with sedentary desk jobs, professionals with physically demanding jobs, stay at home parents, seniors, students, amateur cyclists and golfers, professional dancers, rugby players, netballers.
Our classes are for generally healthy bodies with day-to-day aches and pains. One-on-ones and personal training sessions suit people with individual needs.
The Powerhouse Café
The partner business, The Powerhouse Café, is attached to the studio and is led by Simon Mitchell, a personal trainer and qualified chef – the perfect combination for ensuring the food and drinks are delicious and healthy.
The café offers eat in and take-out food, coffee and drinks, and is a place for studio users to congregate before and after class, creating a sense of community and energy around the studio.
We look forward to seeing you
We look forward to you experiencing Wellington’s friendliest and most effective studio and café. Come and visit us at Marsden Village, city end Karori. Parking is free!

Ben Barba to fight lifetime ban
BY: Loop Pacific
09:42, March 13, 2019
1738 reads
The fallen NRL star presented himself to Mackay police and was charged with two counts of public nuisance over an incident at the Townsville casino in January.
The former Dally M Medallist will appear in Townsville Magistrates Court on March 22.
Barba reportedly will not face domestic violence-related charges because his partner Ainslie Currie has not made a complaint.
Barba was sacked by NRL club North Queensland without playing a game for the club last month over allegations he was violent towards Currie in the incident.

No outcome on SBW appeal
BY: Loop Pacific
06:42, August 2, 2017
807 reads
Williams was appealing the four-match ban from the Lions series that rules him out of the first Bledisloe Cup clash against the Wallabies.
The All Blacks centre was handed the suspension for his second Test send-off against the British & Irish Lions earlier this month.
Williams became the first All Black in 50 years to be sent off in a Test when he was red-carded for a shoulder charge on Lions winger Anthony Watson early in the 24-21 loss in Wellington.
He missed the drawn third Test with the Lions, and the Blues' final Super Rugby match against the Sunwolves.

Memory lane . . . New Zealand sporting great Murray Halberg meets pupils from Waitaki Boys' High School during a visit to Oamaru 30 years ago. This photo appeared in the Oamaru Mail on March 17, 1988. Is that Colin Clearwater? Who else do you recognise? PHOTO: OAMARU MAIL FILES
TOO MUCH SPORT
Yes, you read that correctly.
Too. Much. Sport.
Pray for the Oamaru Maileditor who doesn’t technically have a sports reporter but somehow has to at least try to provide some coverage, even small updates, of a million things.
And it does feel like a million this week, during a time of the year when the seasons are a blur. Let’s get into it.
SEAT OF HIS PANTS
An early shout-out to Oamaru cyclist Tim Rush, who even by his own high standards produced a whale of a performance at the Motatapu last weekend.
Rush placed second, just 17sec behind the winner, in the elite 19-29 years mountain bike category of the massive multisport event held in the Wanaka-Queenstown high country.
But Rush had to survive some drama to get to the finish. He had a fall, breaking some wheel spokes – one of which went into his leg. AND the seat post snapped, so he rode 16km without a seat!
Other locals to do well included Dougal Allan (first in the Xterra), Hamish Elliott (second in the 18-39 years 42km off-road marathon), the Waitaki Boys’ High School duo of Taz Selfe and Blain Hamilton (third overall and first in the open men’s team mountain bike event), and Blair Selfe and Harvey Weir (seventh overall and fifth in masters men in team mountain bike).
There was also a lovely moment in the 8.5km “sawpit run” when three generations of an Oamaru family took part. Mel Lewis, of the Fitness 24 gym, was joined by mum Karen Clement and daughter Monique Lewis.
MAC ATTACK
Mighty Mac . . . North Otago tennis star Mackenzie Phillips (left) with vanquished opponent Rileigh Fields after the Otago Open final at the Edgar Centre in Dunedin at the weekend. PHOTO: SUPPLIED
We appear to have another extremely talented tennis player in this district.
Waitaki Girls’ High School pupil Mackenzie Phillips claimed the Otago Open tennis title in Dunedin at the weekend.
The gun 15-year-old beat Otago’s Rileigh Fields 6-1 7-5 in the final at the Edgar Centre.
SWIMMING UPDATE
Those kids at the Oamaru Swim Club are never treading water.
Eight of the club’s best youngsters are bound for Rotorua to compete in the national division two championships starting on Sunday.
The event is a springboard (pardon the pun) to the next level of competitions, including the New Zealand age group and short course championships.
As usual, master publicist Leigh Petrie has given me a handy summary of the local squad.
The hard-working Halalova Asi (boys 14) is the experienced hand, having competed at this meet last year. He is a particularly strong medal prospect in the 1500m freestyle and could also target the podium in the 400m freestyle.
Of the boys 13 swimmers, Daniel Gilbert is looking good for a medal in the 200m butterfly and Corbin Fraser will look to add qualifying times to his 50m breaststroke for the national championships, while Samuel Petrie (boys 12) will seek to continue his good form.
Jessie Bayley, Kari Croucher, Jocelyn Fellowes and Gemma Green round out the talented team.
SOUTH(LAND) RULES
In case you missed it, the great news is that the Hawke Cup is back on the right side of the Waitaki River.
Southland claimed the symbol of New Zealand districts cricket supremacy with a crushing win over Counties-Manukau earlier this week, a heck of an effort without class acts Jacob Duffy and Harsh Visavadiya.
The swede-eaters will admire the trophy over the winter, and their first defence next summer will be against the southern zone winner (or runner-up, if Southland itself wins the zone). Hopefully that is us.
HISTORY LESSON
Here is the latest “stat chat” courtesy of North Otago club cricket historian Scott Cameron.
He reports, ahead of tomorrow’s Borton Cup final, that Oamaru and Waitaki Boys’ are the only remaining foundation clubs of the North Otago Cricket Association.
Both clubs actually predate the senior competition, which started in the 1899-1900 season.
This is the first time Oamaru (now technically Oamaru-SKC) and Waitaki Boys’ have clashed in a Borton Cup final, being held for a 24th time.
Meanwhile, the Oamaru club tells us James Ferris (my nephew!) has 563 runs (average 62, strike rate 216) and 27 wickets (at 8.67) this season. Nuts.
GOLDEN BOY
It has been a super exciting week for North Otago cricketer Nathan Smith, who was selected to play for the New Zealand XI in a two-day game against the touring English in Hamilton.
There was huge interest in the game all round as it was to be played with a pink ball to help players from both sides prepare for the day-night test.
WHAT A TRIP
North Otago netball identity Carmen Brenssell and husband Wayne (incidentally, my peer support leader at Waitaki Boys’ way back in 1990) are just back from a trip of a lifetime.
The Kakanui farmers won a trip to Australia through a Banks Auto Electrical promotion.
While fishing off Hamilton Island, the Brenssells were rubbing shoulders with two Aussie sporting greats: rugby league legend Andrew Ettingshausen, and cricket superstar Matthew Hayden.
CORRECTION
We were supplied with a wrong name to go with a photo of the Waitaki Girls’ athletic sports last week. That was Sam Slee, not Kate Slee.
HALLELUJAH
Waitaki Boys’ has the best lawn bowlers in the region. Brooklyn Deb and Corey Tynan emerged victorious from 13 teams at the Aoraki secondary schools tournament in Timaru last week.

Biography
A member of Norths' champion backline during the club's only premiership era (1921-22), Herman Peters was one of five clubmates who toured with the 1921-22 Kangaroos. The Norths centre played in only four matches on tour but returned to score a try in the club's 33-5 win over Glebe in 1922 final. When the club's star players left, Peters remained to captain Norths in the 1920s. He became a national selector after his retirement and was a member of the selection panel that was involved in the controversial sacking of Australian captain Len Smith before the 1948-49 Kangaroo Tour. Peters was known as the ‘grand old man’ of the Norths club and was a staunch supporter right up until his death at age 89 in 1989.

Australian Cricket on the Skids
We usually don't make too much comment about cricket during the footy off-season, but at the moment feel that we just need to. At the end of the day, the abilities, heart and desire amongst this cricket team have to be questioned. It appeared that everyone got a little ahead of themselves in Perth, where we rode roughshod on the back of two brilliant performance with the ball from Ryan Harris and Mitch Johnson.
We then got carried away, but we should have still know this:
The Captain, Ricky Ponting is in poor form
His V/C Michael Clark is in poor form
The Top order, is soft and brittle
The Bowlers simply do not dominate sessions of play, don't seem to build pressure and often apepar directionless.
Major changes are needed within our cricket team, starting with selectors and the hierarchy. We need fighters, players that have commitment and a bit of heart, not those that look good on a magazine cover.

Great Hospitality in 2018!
10th April 2018
Venatour offer a wide range of hospitality packages for many major sporting events. We have picked some that you shouldn't miss this summer!
If horse racing is you thing then there is nowhere better to spend the summer than at Royal Ascot. An occasion like no other and a highlight of the racing calendar. Positioned directly opposite the main Grandstand, The Ascot Village makes the perfect base for an exquisite day of hospitality. The stylish interior, excellent catering plus a sprinkling of Ascot theatre make it a day to remember
For two weeks in July, the nation becomes lovers of tennis, campagne, strawberries and cream as Wimbledon returns for another year. Will it be Andy's year again? Will Konta become the first British lady to win it for over 40 years? With fabulous views across to Centre court, The Lakeview Restaurant provides an idyllic location in which to enjoy sumptuous hospitality at this premium event, capturing the essence of the English Summer – it is without doubt Wimbledon’s best kept secret!
The atmosphere at Formular 1 is something everyone should experience at least once. The noise and speed is like nothing else. Join us at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. The Silverstone Six Restaurant is ideally nestled between Maggotts Corner and the Wellington Straight giving you a prime location to watch the racing unfold. As the name suggests, the facility offers views of six corners from the VIP grandstand which include: Maggotts, Becketts, Farm Curve, Village, The Loop and Aintree.
Where will you summer take you?

Great Holiday Ideas with a Discount
March 11, 2014
The winter this year has been the wettest winter recorded in the UK for decades. It brought lots of rain, pain, misery and problems with many areas in the UK under flood alerts. Many homes were damaged, farm lands destroyed, businesses ruined and properties lost notably sea side holiday resorts. It definitely wasn't the best time for holiday cruises with raging storms destroying coast lines. More

Coventry University
Coventry - United Kingdom
Overview
Coventry University has a long tradition as a provider of education. Our roots go as far back as Coventry College of Design in 1843. It was in 1970 that Coventry College of Art amalgamated with Lanchester College of Technology and Rugby College of Engineering Technology. The resulting institution was called Lanchester Polytechnic: 'Lanchester' after the Midlands automotive industry pioneer, Dr Frederick Lanchester, and 'Polytechnic' meaning 'skilled in many sciences and arts'.
In 1987 the name changed to Coventry Polytechnic and in 1992 the University was set up under UK Government legislation, as laid out in the University’s Instrument and Articles of Government.
The Lanchester name has been preserved in the title of our art gallery, the Lanchester Gallery, as well as in the Lanchester Library.
We are a forward-looking, modern university with a proud tradition as a provider of high quality education and a focus on applied research.
Our students benefit from state-of-the-art equipment and facilities in all academic disciplines including health, design and engineering laboratories, performing arts studios and computing centres. We have been chosen to host three national Centres of Excellence in Teaching and Learning which has enabled us to invest substantial sums of money in health, design and mathematics.
Our city-centre campus is continually developing and evolving, and we have plans for further investment in it over the next few years. We are a major presence in Coventry, which contributes to the city's friendly and vibrant atmosphere and also enables us to foster successful business partnerships.
Through our links with leading edge businesses and organisations in the public and voluntary sectors, our students are able to access project and placement opportunities that enhance their employability on graduation.
Our Coventry campus spreads across the heart of the city centre, with each building within easy walking distance.
The main campus comprises of over 20 main student buildings, including our 2 newest buildings; The Hub – a modern social space for the students, and the Engineering & Computing Building which is crammed with technology. These are all managed by the University’s Estates Services, along with the accommodation blocks, student houses, and Technology Park, giving a total of over 130 buildings.
Coventry is a student city that's easy to get to and easy to get around. We're only an hour from London by train and 20 minutes from Birmingham.
There's plenty to do in Coventry as a student, whether you're into music, sport, art or fashion and our city centre campus puts you right at the heart of the action.

June Athlete of the Month || Julia Carrillo
Each month we spotlight a different CFA athlete who stands out and shows just how awesome they are. What is it that makes up an Athlete of the Month? It may not be the person that finishes the fastest, Rx’s every WOD, or gets a PR every time they walk in the gym. Although we love and celebrate when those things happen, the Athlete of the Month is made up of much more than physical ability. This person shows up, gives their best every time, and then gives a little more. They are hungry to learn and always ready to do the work. They support their fellow classmates and encourage them to reach their goals. This athlete embodies what we believe the CrossFit Austin Community should be about.
Our June Athlete of the Month is Julia Carillo! Julia joined us almost a year ago and has found her place with the 4:30 crew. Julia is constantly pushing her limits and it’s resulting in impressive gains in her fitness. She’s always up for the challenge! Not only is she an excellent addition as an athlete, but you’ll find her pretty regularly at our social events too! Julia exemplifies so many of the qualities we look for in an AOM and has shown really amazing progress in his time here. Julia, the CFA Team is proud to honor you as our June Athlete of the Month and as an awesome part of this community. Thanks for your all your hard work and we look forward to seeing all you accomplish in the years to come! Congratulations!
State your Name and/or Nickname please: Julia Carrillo / “Jules” or “Rillo”
Words to live by? Laugh every day
What is your fitness background? It’s not much of a background. I did Drill Team dance in high school, and then stuck to only cardio type workouts for a while. In 2014 I started hitting up the ‘Globo gym’ until I found CrossFit.
How long have you been CrossFitting? This is hard. I’ve done ‘CrossFit style’ workouts for a few years now, but only the less complex movements, (box jumps, wall balls, front squats, etc.). I didn’t learn Olympic lifting, and gymnastic movements until after I joined CFA back in June of 2017.
Take us back to your first day of CrossFit… How did you feel? How do you compare it to workouts today? I did my fundamentals and then didn’t actually show up for a class until a few weeks later. I was incredibly nervous about meeting new people and looking like an idiot. I don’t remember the workout but I remember feeling very welcomed. And hot…soo hot. I feel like the workouts are still just as hard, but now I can do almost everything RX’d.
What’s your favorite part of CrossFit Austin? The trash talking. It gets the blood flowing.
Current Training Goals/PRs? Butterfly pull-ups….and don’t sprain anything or make me bleed my own blood again.
What advice do you have for folks just starting out in CrossFit? 1. It’s not always a competition. 2. Don’t be afraid to let go of the assistance bands and try things RX’d-it’s how you grow. 3. Don’t cheat. You’re only cheating yourself.
What is your cheat meal go to? Pizza and Beer
How do you use your fitness outside of the gym? I would say I go on hikes and play sports, but I don’t. I plan on attending the Peace Officer Academy at my work and I know they will give me plenty of opportunities to use fitness outside of the gym.
Tell us about a moment you felt most proud of yourself during a workout. My first time doing Fran in January. I set up my band on the pull-up bar and then Brenda yelled at me and said I didn’t need it. It was my first workout doing pull-ups unassisted. Then the next highlight was cutting 3 minutes off my Fran time when we tested it again earlier in May.
If you could create a WOD and name it for yourself, what would it be? I would instead create a hero WOD for my brother and name it “TJ” after him. He was killed in action back on June 28th, 2005
28 Minute AMRAP
6 HSPU
6 Pull-ups
6 Burpee over Bar
6 DL @ 105/155
6 Power Clean @ 105/155
28 Double Unders
What are your hobbies, interests and/or talents outside of CrossFit? I love a lazy day just watching Netflix, but I also love being out in the sun, hanging with friends, family, dogs and the boyfriend. I also enjoy dabbling in videography and making videos highlighting peoples’ suffering, (2018 CrossFit Open).
Tell us something we don’t know about you… I am a licensed Cosmetologist. Oh, and ya know the giant Bronze Beaver outside Buc-ees stores? I helped design his shoes.
Longhorns or Aggies? Broncos
Leave the fine folks of CrossFit Austin with some parting words… Sooner or later, everybody goes to the zoo.

Parkinson’s Law and Your Time || A Word from Jeremy Jones
Hey Everyone!
Parkinson’s Law: “Work will always expand to use all of the time and money allocated to it.”
Or as Isaac Asimov put it: “In ten hours a day you have time to fall twice as far behind your commitments as in five hours a day.”
We are going apply this principle to make your life better.
When people used to ask “How are you doing?” the default answer was always “good” or “alright.”
It appears that this has been supplanted with the modern mantra: “BUSY.”
Why is that?
Why is it that we spend less time than our forebears doing chores, getting from place to place, being forced to watch commercials, waiting on food to cook, etc. and yet we feel more ‘busy’ than ever?
One of the primary reasons is that we are consuming more media. We are filling every minute with social media feeds, news, videos, and games. We have more ‘free’ time than any generation in history, but we have so many more convenient things to do with it!
For example, people used to watch a 2-3 hours of television at night. A lot of that was commercials and shows that weren’t exactly what people wanted to watch (so they might do other things at the same time like cook dinner, or read the paper). Now days, you’ll turn on Netflix and watch for 4 hours of back to back shows of exactly what you want to see. You may end up browsing Facebook or Instagram at the same time, but you will definitely be more engaged than when you were watching an ‘okay’ show with a commercial break every 5-7 minutes.
The problem is that these new activities are DESIGNED to keep you on as long as possible. Companies have spent billions of dollars figuring out how to keep you scrolling, clicking, and engaging. They have trained us to reach for the app as soon as we have the smallest moment of boredom or when we need a break from whatever we are doing.
Even when we are deep into another task or conversation, the ding, the beep, and the buzz, call us back to the fountain of distraction. There is a reason why the alerts on the screen are red. This is because red is the most catching eye color (possibly linked to our primal brain looking for ripe fruit or danger). These alerts are like little electric zaps to our brain to stop what we are doing and get back to scrolling, clicking, and engaging.
What does this have to do with Parkinson’s Law?
At work, if a project is supposed to take 2 weeks, it will take 2 weeks (or longer). That is because the amount of work you’ll do on it will grow to fill the time allotted. We will not finish the project early and then blow off the rest of the time. We will find details to nitpick. We will do more research, have more meetings, or add more features… (exactly what I did when making these brilliant illustrations).
This is also true in the rest of our lives. If we stack our time with all of the things we want to get done, and there is some extra time left over, we’ll try to squeeze in more (to ‘get ahead’), or we’ll fill the time with more scrolling, clicking, and engaging (when we should be being productive). We’ll be distractedly loading our truck with stuff while racing toward a ‘burnout cliff’.
After the dust has settled, after everything else is done, THEN we’ll find time to ‘Recharge’. To workout… or take a day to ourselves… or to spend time with our families.
The equation looks like this:
Total Time (to get things done) – Tasks (time to get them done) = Recharge Time
The problem with this is that we’ll never run out of tasks to get done, so we’ll never have time to recharge. We’ll keep packing that schedule with more and more tasks, and we’ll fill in the gaps with more ‘neutral/wasted’ time of scrolling, clicking, and engaging. Not to mention, those dings, beeps, and buzzes make us less effective at our tasks because we keep switching modes, making them take longer than needed.
Side Note: There is no place this is more prevalent than with a business owner or a large family. With a business owner, there is no end to the tasks that need to get done; More cleaning. Updating the website. More meetings. More product development. More research. More organizing and filing. More tracking… With families it is; More activities. More time on homework. More chores. More outings…
To combat this, we need to switch up the equation a bit (don’t worry, if you aren’t good at math it is still pretty easy to follow).
Total Time (to get things done) – Recharge Time = Tasks (time to get them done)
What we are effectively talking about is that we need to put times on our calendar for Recharge Time BEFORE we stack our calendar with tasks and events that need to get done.
This simple shift will do a number of things for you (and your work, and your family)
First, you will create a sustainable schedule. You will be able to maintain this schedule for the rest of your life because you won’t be playing chicken with the burn-out cliff. You’ll be able to handle stress better. You’ll be happier and more relaxed. You’ll be a better spouse, parent, friend, and coworker. You’ll also be able to handle any curveballs or busy seasons as they inevitably pop up.
Next, you’ll find that you work more effectively. Jeff Bezos of Amazon HATES term ‘work life balance’because it implies an either/or mentality. A tug-of-war between the two. He believes in work life synergy. That if your work life is energizing and metered, it will make your home life better because you are coming home more energized and less stressed. If you home life is energizing, it will make you better at work because you are more productive, creative, and driven.
By guaranteeing time each week to ‘Recharge’ and do life giving things, you will be more excited about work. You will be more creative, more productive, and much more fun to work with. By preventing work from stealing your ‘Recharge’ time, you’ll have more time to take care of yourself, to learn, to grow, and to be present with your family and friends.
You will also learn how to work more efficiently. Instead of working on that project at night or on the weekends, you’ll work your hardest when you are supposed to. Then you’ll hit ‘submit’ when it is ‘good enough’ (instead of spending time on the extra stuff because you still have time). You will find it easier to turn off the alerts and stick to the task, rather than let yourself get distracted with work that is ‘urgent’ rather than ‘important/productive’.
Finally, you’ll also discover how to say “No”.
You’ll have a more realistic idea of what you can do in a normal week, and you’ll be able to select what you want to spend your time on. Instead of saying “yes” to the extra events/projects/edits, you’ll say “No” or you’ll say: “Yes, BUT…” As in: ‘yes I can do that, BUT it is going to take an extra week or two, and these other things will be put on hold’.
With the original equation, you’d ‘find the time’ by sacrificing your Recharge Time. With the new equation, you’ll be able to protect yourself from overcommitting/burning out, making mistakes, and missing decades of living a great life.
What does it mean to “Recharge”?
Everyone’s Recharge time is going to be a bit different. It is usually a good idea to break it up into three categories: Small Charge, Medium Charge, and Big Charge.
Small Charges are what happen during normal days of the week where you have work and school schedules to work around. We cultivate these small charges by doing things like holding to a schedule of going to the gym 3-4 times a week. Not working past 7pm. Spending 10-30 minutes regularly meditating, praying, or journaling. Setting a rule of ‘no electronics during dinner’. Avoiding too many commitments during the week that will cut into quality time.
Medium Charges are our once per week ‘Sabbath’ and/or 2-3 days every month or three. Times where we choose to not answer work email and/or go on social media. Time we can spend doing the things we love with the people we love. It could be going to the gym to do fun things with friends, or it could be staying home to play games with the family. It could be doing projects around the house or doing charity work. It could be a long weekend camping or visiting friends/family away from the usual hustle and bustle of the daily grind.
Big Charges are vacations. We need these 1-2 times per year. A week at a time is minimum (2 or more weeks is better). It will take most people 2-4 days to finally relax and get the maximum benefit. It doesn’t have to be elaborate or expensive. Going on a road trip, camping, visiting relatives (that you like) are all good options, but leaving the country is better. The key is to ‘leave work at the office’. Don’t obsessively check email while you are gone.
Vacations are particularly important for businesses/work.
If you own the business, this is your chance to test the systems and people you have in place to see how the place runs when you are gone. It is a way to create more efficiency and assign responsibility. The goal is to take longer and longer ‘breaks’ from your business to make sure your business is able to thrive without you (and to have the ability to focus on specific parts of the business when you are around).
If you are working at a company or with a team, this is the time for them to recognize your contributions. You will have to spend the time prepping everyone for your departure (the more ‘prep’, the more important your role). That said, you want your absence to be noticed. You want your peers and your direct reports to miss you. This signifies to the company (and your boss) that you are playing an important role and that your job cannot be easily liquidated or outsourced.
Big Charges are also times to reflect on your path. After a two-week vacation, are you energized and looking forward to getting back to work? Are you missing your colleagues and clients? If you can’t get ‘juiced’ about your career after a fulfilling two-week vacation, it may be time for you to look at moving on to something else or changing how you operate.
Side Note: It may come as a shock to you, but many gym owners (and small business owners in general) get into a place where they are struggling. Struggling emotionally and physically. They are stressed, and their fitness has plummeted. It is because what used to be a passion and life-giving thing, a Recharge, (hanging out at the gym with friends), has become an unending source of work tasks. They have lost one of their most critical Recharge tools! Setting boundaries and finding activities and friends outside of the business is critical to creating that work-life synergy.
Where to Start
So you may be saying to yourself “Sounds great! But I can’t do that. I don’t even know where to start!”
It starts with blocking time on your calendar and holding yourself accountable to stick to it. LITTERALLY blocking time on your calendar as a weekly appointment. It is a good idea to select a few days during your work week where you won’t take on tasks past a certain time. You can also set standards around events each day where everyone (including yourself) is required to put devices away and be present (like breakfasts or dinners).
The next big step is blocking a day off each week for that day ‘off’. For most folks, Sunday will be the day where you don’t check email and/or stay off social media completely (highly recommended). You will also want to ‘protect’ this day from other obligations that may not seem like ‘work’ but are certainly not ‘life-giving’ (like events that you feel obliged to attend, but really dread having to go).
You will also want to have a ‘long weekend’ planned every month (or two, or three). One period where you can link 2-3 days of uninterrupted time away from the grind. You do not have to leave town every time. These ‘Medium Charge’ long weekends can be ‘stay-cations’ where you stay in the area and only do things that you and your family enjoy.
And finally, you’ll want to plan those 1+ week long week vacations every year (or more). Take some of your ‘Small Charge’ time to plan these trips and bask in the planning process. Remember that planning and looking forward to a trip can be just as fulfilling as the trip itself!
Start Small
Set a schedule of making it to the gym or working out 3-4 days per week. Then pick a day or two per week where you ‘clock out’ of work and social media or games (use this time to read, do self care like meditation, journaling, family time, stretching, or a hot bath).
Next, set a day per week to devote completely to yourself and your family/friends. Sleep in if you can. Avoid the ding, the beep, and the buzz by leaving your phone behind or turning off alerts for the day.Spend the day doing things you enjoy, getting outdoors, cooking, or doing a hobby separate from work.
Then, plan that vacation. Set it one year from now or less (if you can). Put it on your calendar, and then set reminders ever month or two to make sure you are planning for a long departure (financially as well as time wise).
Keep in mind that you may have to cut things away that are sucking away your time or your life.Some of these things will seem valuable or important, but you will most likely not miss them once they are gone. Much of the importance we have placed on them is fabricated by ourselves and society. We hold on to them because we have invested too much (like watching a show that has jumped the shark on season 4 of 8), because of commitments we have made (we told someone we’d do it), or because we don’t want to be judged (we don’t want people to see us as ‘quitters’). If it is important, we’ll make it work in the time allotted. If it isn’t able to fit around our Recharge schedule, it should be dumped like useless cargo from a damaged ship.
Rainy Days, Curveballs, and Big Opportunities
So now we have a concrete schedule that we protect as if our life depends on it (because it does) … But what happens when we hit a rainy day (a string of events that requires resources not planned for), a curveball (an extreme event completely unexpected), or a big opportunity (something we’d be foolish to pass up)?
The power of creating space for Recharge Time is that we have the bandwidth and the flexibility to take on these new challenges when they come up.
There will be times where we have to ‘spend’ some of our Recharge Time to handle the emergency, to get caught up, or to position ourselves for the big win. The problem with the way most people operate is that when these things come up, they are already too stretched to handle it effectively!
They are NOT rested. There is no additional time to fit it in. They will have to sacrifice work, family, or health to keep things afloat (rather than ‘pull the oar’ with gusto). They will not be able to minimize the damage, expediate through the rough patch, or make the most out of the opportunity given.
By making Recharge Time a priority, these challenges (which are a normal part of life) will not seem so daunting and will not ‘push us over the edge’ because we have the resources to handle them.
Final Thoughts
Some ‘successful’ people talk all about the ‘hustle’. They never stop going on about how hard they are working, how many things they are doing, and how many hours they are putting in. They talk about how much you have to sacrifice to succeed. They don’t talk about how much down time they have or times they have failed because they were dropping the ball from being overwhelmed.
Other seemingly ‘successful’ people only seem to talk about their adventures and vacations. Their lives seem to be one flight to a cool destination to another. They gloss over the fact that between these events they are putting in the long hours and grinding out productivity like nobody’s business.
Don’t believe the hype.
The reality is that truly successful people, the people that have a great work life, a great home life, AND a great internal life, are using both the work moments and the Recharge moments to make their lives better. These elements work together to make them both productive AND happy.
They are doing meaningful work, while enjoying life/relationships, and they have control over their destiny…
Total Time (to get things done) – Recharge Time = Tasks (time to get them done)
Keep this equation in mind. Implement this strategy to protect your time.
If you do it correctly, you’ll have a new answer to the question: ‘How are you?’
Your answer will be:
“I am busy living a great life. How are you?”
Thrive on.
-jj
ACTION ITEM: Now that you have finished reading this, copy and paste it (or a link to it) on your calendar 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks from now. Use these reminders to make sure you are prioritizing the Recharge Time like you should!

DRINK! DRINK! DRINK! Water that is….
Today we are kickin’ it back to an article Coach Tim wrote in years past. We are feeling the heat of these warmer days like a humid hug we’d rather not be in the middle of and when you’re sweating it out like we do, you have to be putting it back in. Check out some wise words from a wise man while you enjoy a nice, cold glass of H20!
H2O is Mo’ Better! || Coach Tim Garland
The heat has begun to grace us with its presence. As our bodies adapt to the heat and humidity that this season brings us, you hear your coaches tell you to make sure you are drinking plenty of water. What is “plenty”? Why is it so important?
Many of us know that water comprises the majority of our body. So making sure that we are consuming an appropriate amount of this clear, flavorless liquid is a no-brainer requirement for optimal health. Now, imagine yourself this summer hiking the Greenbelt, completing your WOD, or sitting by pool/river/lake for countless hours…without any water. Thirsty thoughts? Thirst is often thought of as an alert for the beginnings of dehydration. According to Merriam-Webster, dehydration is defined as;
Dehydration– an abnormal depletion of body fluids
I don’t think anyone would argue that the aforementioned activities could bring on the onset of dehydration without appropriate measures being taken. Most of us have heard the 6-8, 8oz. cups of water per day as the standard for water consumption. Yes, this is standard. However, just as our nutritional fingerprint differs from individual to individual, so should our water intake. We all come in different shapes and sizes and participate at different levels in vastly different activities. Additionally, depending on our current state of health, some systems are more efficient than others at regulating the needs of said activities. Without throwing specific recommendations out there for person A, weighing ‘x’ amount at such and such height yada-yada ya…here are some dehydration indicators to be aware this summer to help you key in on your health, thus your performance, as it pertains to water intake.
A few symptoms have been identified as;
Little to no urine, or dark yellow/amber hued urine
Headaches
Dizziness/lightheadedness
Dry mouth
Confusion
Conversely, proper hydration helps eliminate the chances of these occurring, and can aid us in;
Regulating core body temperature
Lubricating our joints
Keeping our kidneys and liver healthy by flushing out toxins and eliminating waste
Helps carry oxygen and nutrients to our cells and tissues
Are there other sources to help me stay hydrated other than JUST water? Yes. Although here, water is king, here are a few other ways to sneak in the liquid. Fruits and vegetables contain small amounts of h2o, as well as their juices. Keep in mind that the juices may have unwanted calories due to added sugars. Coffee and teas also contain water, but caffeine can act as a diuretic and lead to frequent urination and counter our purpose.
All in all, plan and prepare for your daily activities.
Be aware of your environment (heat and humidity) and what your body is telling you
Keep a mental note of your previous 12-24 hours of water intake
Keeping a water bottle with you throughout your day will help you monitor your water consumption
Adjust your consumption as needed to fit your daily activity level
“Mama said Gatorade is the devil”
Train smart, live smart,
-Coach Garland

What is this Endurance class all about??
What is CrossFit Endurance? In a nutshell, CFE combines functional strength and mobility exercises with a high-intensity interval regimen in a series of short, intense workouts designed to build all-over strength and boost the limits of your cardiovascular capacity. CFE is a sports-specific plan that alternates between running technique sessions and customized, CrossFit-like workouts.
Or according to John McBrien, a CrossFit Endurance coach. “Find the area where you suck, and then make it suck less”.
The goals of this course are to:
Increase Aerobic Capacity, which is the base of all metabolic performance
Limit your road time and increase the work you’re doing in the gym.
Reduce mileage and instead focus on both form and high-intensity training, thereby creating a stronger, more skillful, more durable athlete.
Reduce injury risk as “junk” mileage is replaced with functional CFE workouts that train the same energy systems
Increase explosive power and speed
Increase mobility and range of motion through incorporating workouts that improve range of motion in the joints and muscle tissues
Increase production of human growth hormone, which helps counter the natural loss of muscle mass that comes with age
Improve coordination of upper- and lower-body muscle groups through the inclusion of compound movements in training
Increae race performance through greater strength, improved form, and greater running efficiency
This class is open to all levels of fitness.
Join Coach Jesse Ruiz for our 6-week Endurance class from July 8 – August 16. Sundays at 5 pm and Thursdays at 7 pm. See you there!

Welcome Coach Jesse Ruiz!
We are excited to welcome Coach Jesse Ruiz for our first of many 6-week courses that are meant to get us our of our regular pattern, experience new ways of moving, and bring added value to the work we do here day in and day out!
Beginning on Sunday, May 13 Jesse will lead us in a 6 week Endurance course twice a week. Classes will take place on Sundays at 6:00 pm and Thursdays and 7:00 pm. Don’t miss out on this opportunity folks!
About Jesse:
Jesse began his formal education at Texas State University, where he received a degree in Exercise and Sports Science while working with the Sports Club teams there. After training the Men’s and Women’s Rugby teams, along with the Women’s soccer club teams, he came to realize his passion for sports could be extended into the fitness realm. He then came to Crossfit in 2010, at Crossfit San Marcos.
Being a life long fitness enthusiast, he was quickly drawn to the endurance aspect of the sport and despite making vast improvements, quickly realized how restricted certain parts of his body were and stumbled onto Kelly Starrett’s Supple Leopard book and his love affair with all aspects of mobility training began. Jesse has spent the past 7 years studying, investigating, and experimenting the many ways to decrease pain in the body, while increasing strength through range of motion.
Having experienced 2 major sports injuries himself (paralyzed from the neck down and a torn ACL/medial meniscus), the importance of quality and pain free movement has become a part of his fitness fabric.
He currently holds a CrossFit Olympic lifting certification, which was taught by the great Coach Mike Burgener. In addition, he is a Primary Movement Specialist with Primal7, completed a Level 1 Coaching Certification with Atomic Athlete, as well as having interned at GRIT Strength and Conditioning gym. Jesse has spent the last 7 years studying movement patterns and infusing that training into both his and his clients training. He’s an avid trail and trail relay runner, has competed in the AFMFITTEST the past 3 years, as well as running numerous ½ marathons, 10k’s, and trail runs around the great State.
A Word From Jesse:
As a Kstar disciple, I’ve spent the past 7 years studying, investigating, and experimenting the many ways to decrease pain in the body, while increasing strength and endurance through range of motion. I’ve also competed in a wide range of road and trail races. I believe that this industry chose me and that journey began in middle school, as I suffered a pinched nerve in my neck, while playing football and was temporarily paralyzed from the neck down. I believe that we possess the innate ability to maintain our bodies and to live, move, and breathe pain free, both in a physical, mental, and spiritual state.
While at Texas State, I was able to coach both collegiate club soccer and rugby players and quickly realized my passion for coaching others. In 2011, I discovered the sport of Crossfit and my journey into the fitness and coaching industry began. I’m honored to share my passion for quality movement and endurance with the CF Austin community! Cheers to being Supple Leopards my friends!

Diaries of a Coach || Get back on track
They say bad things happen in three’s right? Please tell me it’s true because lately it feels like everything has blown up at once. One thing, then another. Then another. And now I’m standing in a big ol’ heaping pile of ashes and mess, trying to piece things back together. But nothing else can happen… because that’s three. That’s it. Right?
What a perfect example of our best laid plans being at the mercy of life. A few weeks ago, I confessed a consistent weakness in my training, running. While I had every intention of implementing a consistent running program, I’ve veered slightly off course. That is my confession to you today. I could tell you all the reasons why, but the fact is, life happened and now I need to get back on track (<— See what I did there? Like… literally get back on the track. Eh?)
Yesterday’s workout was a humbling reminder for me that this is still something I need to work on. Very much so. Although, surely it counts for at least half of the running I missed, right?!?!
My gut reaction is to immediately be discouraged and come down hard on myself. I’ll give you grace all day long, but not myself. No way. With myself, I tend to expect nothing but success and follow through and perfection. Like I’m some sort of super human. Sounds ridiculous when I say it out loud, but it’s true. Instead, today, I’m choosing to accept where I am and take some steps back in the right direction.
Lucky for me, and for you if you find yourself where I am, humbled by yesterday’s workout, the cardiovascular expenditure required, and my lacking, there are some good things coming up to take advantage of here at CFA. Things that can help progress us in the way of endurance in our training.
Starting May 13th, Coach Jesse Ruiz will be starting a 6-week endurance course. This course is designed to challenge your current level of endurance, building and progressing towards higher stamina that will carry over not only into your workouts, but into life. Stay tuned for more info and a bio from Jesse, coming later this week!
Thanks for letting me come clean. Keep me accountable for continued grace in my failures and perseverance toward my goals.

May Athlete of the Month || Edgar Cervera!
Each month we spotlight a different CFA athlete who stands out and shows just how awesome they are. What is it that makes up an Athlete of the Month? It may not be the person that finishes the fastest, Rx’s every WOD, or gets a PR every time they walk in the gym. Although we love and celebrate when those things happen, the Athlete of the Month is made up of much more than physical ability. This person shows up, gives their best every time, and then gives a little more. They are hungry to learn and always ready to do the work. They support their fellow classmates and encourage them to reach their goals. This athlete embodies what we believe the CrossFit Austin Community should be about.
Our May Athlete of the Month is Edgar Cervera! Edgar joined our crew in November 2015 and over the years has gotten his family on board too! He’s a regular with the chicken o’clock crew (5:30 am) but sometimes you’ll see him pop in for a second helping during the 5:30 pm while his 2 boys are rockin’ it with Dylan in the Oly center. Edgar knows what hard work is and doesn’t shy from it one bit. He does what it takes to see the results he’s after. Edgar exemplifies so many of the qualities we look for in an AOM and has shown really amazing progress in his time here. Edgar, the CFA Team is proud to honor you as our May Athlete of the Month and as an awesome part of this community. Thanks for your all your hard work and we look forward to seeing all you accomplish in the years to come! Congratulations!
State your Name and/or Nickname please:

Diaries of a Coach 024 || “Listen to your body!”
“Listen to your body.”
Isn’t that such a weird thing to say? Maybe it’s just me but part of me, when urged to do just that, wonders, “Huh? What does that even mean?” I control this thing, I’m driving the ship here, pretty sure my body is going to listen to me. Right?
Nah.
As some of you may know, I recently traveled to my fine home state of Kentucky. Side note: I went to celebrate my nephew’s 1st birthday and y’all. He. Is. The. Cutest. See photo attached. Cue the ooos and awwws. And also, you’re welcome.
Anywho, two days prior I got pretty sick. Sick enough to consider canceling my trip. After much debate I decided to tough it out and make the trek. Let’s be honest, I’d do anything for that little nugget. #auntlife
With a late flight arrival in My Old Kentucky Home (See what I did there? Probably not… it’s a song. Google it. Or watch the Kentucky Derby, you’ll hear it!) it was easy to pass out almost instantaneously. However, the next day I found myself sending my sister out to run errands alone that morning so I could sleep a little later, falling asleep on the couch mid afternoon for about an hour, and then dosing off during an evening movie when I was supposed to be helping with party decor. The next day was no different, I slept late that morning and I’m pretty sure the sun was up when I went to bed that evening. Not only did I snag copious amounts of sleep, but I worked out approximately zero times during my time at home. That’s reason enough to stick the back of your palm on my forehead, raise a confused brow and say, “Are you ok?”
Here’s the lesson. Lean in because it’s enlightening and borderline revolutionary. Apparently, when you fall asleep at random times during the day, your body is trying to tell you something, mainly, that you need to sleep. (Maybe listen a little closer next time, Erica.)
All jokes aside, my encouragement today is just to tune in. I know it’s weird but how do you feel? Like, right now? When you move, does your body resist? Are you lethargic and unenthused when it’s time to workout? When you rest, does your body overdose? Do you feel like you just can’t get enough? Maybe not, maybe movement energizes you. Then keep moving! Rest is always essential but maybe your body is up no problem when that alarm goes off. Then get up and go! Just promise me that you’ll keep checking in, keep listening, because those signs and signals are there and always changing.
Spoiler alert. You are only human and many times, as humans, we are at the mercy of our circumstances and busy schedules, our ever-changing emotions (just me?), and the chemicals that balance and unbalance within us. Take time to check in, take time to rest if that’s what you need. You only have you, and you’re a pretty important part of living the life you want to live, fulfilling the dreams and desires your heart has. Take care of you boo!
I’m out. Maybe to go sleep, who knows!

Jazz Joan and Cigarettes.
The official guide for the Marciac Jazz festival arrived a couple of weeks ago.
Here we are in a small town in the Gers department in South West France. The population is around 1,300, and it boasts a beautiful central square with covered arcades, perfect for finding shade in the summer, and avoiding the rain in the winter. Normally the town is quiet, there is a market on Wednesday, there are a couple of good restaurants, you can take a walk around the lake, it’s pleasant, it’s rural France.
This all changes at the end of July. This year, from the 27th July through to the 15th August it will be the 41st Marciac Jazz festival. It all started when Jean Louis Guilhaumon arrived in Marciac to teach English at the College. A lover of Jazz, he invited some of his musician friends from Paris to come to the South West to enjoy the calm and to play music. It all started in the garage of a local resident, and grew from there, and how it has grown!
This year around 200,000 visitors are expected to descend upon the village, it sounds impossible, but it works! A huge marquee, the Chapiteau, goes up on the rugby pitch, seating 5,000 for the major concerts, the main square becomes an open air space for the all day free concerts, stalls and restaurants pop up in the surrounding streets. Marciac lives for music, for fun. There is also the Astrada, the state of the art concert hall which opened in 2011, seating 500, and there are workshops and master classes. Just looking at the programme, and seeing that there are at least two performances every night in the Chapiteau and the Astrada, a rough calculation gives you a figure of around 78 artists to choose from during the official festival, and that’s not counting the free concerts, and the many musicians who play in the restaurants or the street.
The big name this year is Joan Baez. She is to play the final concert. As soon as the programme was announced, her gig was sold out! It took me back to Dublin in the 60s.
At the time I was a huge fan of Joan Baez, I constantly played her albums, I loved her clear pure voice, her engagement in the issues of the day, her dignity. When I saw she was to play at the National Stadium I immediately booked a seat. There was a huge buzz in the audience as Joan took to the stage. She played her first number, and the crowd roared their approval. She then spoke out. ‘I can see there are people smoking in the auditorium’. And? Through the usual haze of smoke, we looked at her in bemusement. She continued, ‘I want you all to put out your cigarettes, or I won’t sing any more.’
Silence, then an astonished chatter ‘Wha’? and ultimately, the sound of butts being put out in the ash trays. After all, you’d paid to see the woman sing, one song wasn’t going to cut it. She resumed the programme, she was great, the smoke gradually wafted away, the applause was generous, but perhaps not as enthusiastic as it was at the beginning. Telling a Dublin audience off was courageous, but not necessarily popular.
After that concert, my enthusiasm for her changed. Somehow that wonderfully clear strong voice sounded more hectoring, schoolmarmish, like she was bossing me around, making me listen to what she wanted to say, rather than involving me. I lost interest, and there were many others who could fill the space. I had hardly heard of her for years, and to see the immediate effect in Marciac was startling.
One of the advantages of the Chapiteau is that even if the place is filled, you can hang around outside the marquee, sit on the grass, drink a glass of wine, and still hear the concert. For old times’ sake I may well go, and I’ll be sure to take some cigarettes!

The Raptors Must HATE Their Fans
By slanch Leave a Comment	
Categories: Basketball and Celebrities
Tags: Fan Night, New Jersey Nets, Toronto Raptors, Vanilla Ice
The Toronto Raptors must be trying to drive down their attendance or something, that’s the only reason I can think of for why they would unleash a cruel and unusual punishment on their fanbase. On February 3rd the team will hold “Fan Night” at the Air Canada Centre, innocuous enough, in fact, down right pleasant; but wait, there’s MORE!
The game will be held against the New Jersey Nets! Yes the same team that currently sits 2-26 and has shown no sign of ever improving. Wow, what a GAME! If that’s not enough to get you into the game, THERE’S MORE!
At halftime, for the fans, as a way to HONOR and APPRECIATE them, the Raptors will unleash VANILLA ICE!
ACK!
WHY! How much would they have to pay you to go to that game? Hundreds of American dollars right?
Is there some kind of plot where the owner of the Raptors wants to lower attendance in order to relocate to Miami? Otherwise, this just seems especially cruel.

Anna Kournikova Visits the Troops
By slanch Leave a Comment	
Categories: Awesome, Celebrities, Hot Women and Tennis
Tags: Afghanistan, Anna Kournikova, Billy Ray Cyrus, Dave Attell, Nick Bollettieri, USO
She didn’t win any tournaments when she was a on the professional tennis tour, but I’m sure Anna Kournikova won over a few hearts when she recently visited some of the troops stationed at the North Kabul International Airport compound in Afghanistan. The USO-sponsored trip brought Kournikova, comedian Dave Attell, singer Billy Ray Cyrus (sans Miley which I’m sure was the most disappointing to the soldiers) and of course, the big star, tennis coach Nick Bollettieri (who? yeah, I don’t know either.)’
I think it’s safe to say that, as funny as he is, Dave Attell was NOT the most looked-forward to celebrity for the soldiers. Kournikova was extremely gracious on her 3rd USO trip, signing autographs and taking loads of pictures with the assembled troops “I am extremely proud and privileged to be here,” she told them. “Thank you so much to you and your family for all you do.”

Tags: Benjamin Brady, Gisele, Gisele Bundchen, Tom Brady
Despite having been born on December 8th, Tom Brady and Gisele had struggled to come up with a name for their bouncing baby boy. Well, the wait is over, the future stud/football star has a name. On her website, Gisele posted this bit of news today:
Hello!
I want to thank you all with all my heart for the immense love I have received here on the website. It is a pleasure to receive messages from each one of you here.
I am living a very special moment in my life, Benjamin is a blessing and I could not be happier.
I would also like to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and 2010 with lots of light!
Kisses Gisele
Did you see how she sent me kisses! I think my messages have been getting through to her!
hat’s gotta sting.

Brady and Gisele Birth Out a Son
By slanch Leave a Comment	
Categories: Awesome, Boston, Celebrities, Football and Hot Women
Tags: Baby, Gisele Bundchen, Tom Brady
Earlier this morning, according to People Magazine, Gisele Bundchen and Tom Brady welcomed the newest little bundle of joy into their family. Prior to the birth, Gisele had told Brady she didn’t wish to know the baby’s sex, preferring to be surprised; well, it’s a BOY!
The lucky, as yet unnamed lad is the first child for the happy couple and Tom’s second son, joining 2-year-old Jack. Just 9 more and he’s got his own offensive squad!
Both mother and baby are doing well.
Congrats Tom and Gisele!

The Media Can’t Get Enough of Tiger, Even When There’s Nothing
By slanch Leave a Comment	
Categories: Celebrities, Douches, Golf, Pop Culture and Television
Tags: Celebrity Obsessions, The Daily Show, Tiger Woods
I have zero interest in getting into the whole Tiger Woods story, frankly, who gives a shit whether or not he cheats on his wife; besides her, obviously. It does nothing to my life and doesn’t particularly change my opinion of him which is based around the fact that he is a really amazing golfer. Everything else is irrelevant.
Having said that, here is a hilarious clip from Tuesday’s Daily Show where they just straight up eviscerate the cable news channels’ overbearing coverage of a story for which they had practically no factual information but spent dozens of hours wasting oxygen with scurrilous rumors, speculation and innuendo.
Vodpod videos no longer available.
I simply don’t get why everyone is so obsessed with this story, the constant rubbernecking in these situations just simply disgusts me. Great, he cheated on his wife, I don’t get it, I’m not a cheater, but I know plenty of dudes who are, it’s not that unusual, but his cheating affects 3 people, his wife and his 2 kids, that’s it. Everyone else is irrelevant. The constant breathless updates from the “news” media are skeevy and perverse.
Besides, none of this is news to me, back when I worked at Men’s Fitness magazine in 2007 I was privy to information that the National Enquirer (which is owned by the same parent company and shares offices) had caught Tiger in flagrante delicto. In exchange for burying the story he agreed to do a cover story for the magazine; something it could never have gotten otherwise with its low profile and shitty sales. I didn’t care then and I don’t care now. What other men do with their penii is irrelevant to me; It’s only mine I’m concerned with.

Derek Jeter is a BUM!
By slanch 4 Comments	
Categories: Baseball, Celebrities, Movies and Pop Culture
Tags: Derek Jeter, Mark Wahlberg, New York Yankees, Will Ferrell
Noted thespian Derek Jeter was down on Coney Island yesterday filming a bit part for Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell’s new movie, The Other Guys playing a part that’s a bit incongruous with his normal image, a homeless beggar.
Wearing a silver wig, a dirty stained jacket and torn-up sneakers, Jeter gamely faced the wind and chill in the air to film his part outside Coney Island’s famous Nathans Hot Dogs.
Expect him to receive an Oscar nomination despite the fact that there were a slew of candidates with legitimate range available.

Please join us in this cause and sign the petition below so we can all share in this special and fantastic moment of baseball history. THANKS!

Two Ulster and Ireland rugby stars who were acquitted of raping the same woman have been sacked.
Employers Ulster Rugby and the Irish Rugby Football Union have confirmed Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding&apos;s departure following an internal review into their conduct.
While Jackson, 26, and Olding, 25 were found not guilty last month after a high-profile trial, other aspects of their behaviour have been heavily criticised, with major sponsors of Ulster Rugby having voiced concern.
The IRFU and Ulster Rugby review had focused on a series of sexually explicit WhatsApp conversations involving the players and their friends about the sexual encounter at the centre of the rape trial.
In a statement the IRFU and Ulster Rugby said: "Following a review, conducted in the aftermath of recent court proceedings, the Irish Rugby Football Union and Ulster Rugby have revoked the contracts of Patrick Jackson and Stuart Olding with immediate effect.

Paddy Jackson makes bid to recover £100,000 legal fees from Rugby rape trial
"In arriving at this decision, the Irish Rugby Football Union and Ulster Rugby acknowledge our responsibility and commitment to the core values of the game: Respect, Inclusivity and Integrity.
"It has been agreed, as part of this commitment, to conduct an in-depth review of existing structures and educational programmes, within the game in Ireland, to ensure the importance of these core values is clearly understood, supported and practised at every level of the game."
Jackson expressed his disappointment.
In a statement to the Press Association he said: "I am deeply disappointed about the outcome of the IRFU and Ulster Rugby&apos;s internal review.
"However, I recognise that my behaviour has fallen far short of the values expected of me as an international player, a role model for the game of rugby and as a son and a brother. I am truly sorry.
"Since I was a young boy it was my ambition to play for Ulster and Ireland and I am extremely proud, privileged and honoured to have done so. It is therefore with great sadness and regret but with many cherished memories that I leave that behind.
"I would like to thank everyone who has supported me throughout this process. I have taken great strength from that support. I&apos;d also like to thank Ulster and Irish rugby for the opportunities that they provided for me and I wish them, and all my former team mates, every success.

"My focus in the months and years ahead will be on rebuilding the trust placed in me by people throughout Ulster and Ireland."
Stuart Olding also issued a statement expressing his regret.
It said: "It is with regret that I have been informed that the IRFU have decided to revoke my contract.
"As I said outside court following my acquittal, I am and will always be fiercely proud of having played for my province and country.
"I very much wished to continue to have the opportunity to represent them.
"Regrettably, influences outside of my contractual arrangement have made it impossible for that to happen.
"I said outside court that the Stuart Olding that you read about in the trial is not the real Stuart Olding.
"The treatment that I have received since my acquittal, both fair and unfair, has made me even more determined to prove myself.
"With the support of my family and friends I shall seek new challenges elsewhere. I bear no one any ill will.
"I am very sorry that this day has come to pass.
"To those who have supported me through these last 20 months and especially the fans who continue to support me, I thank you all."
Fellow Ireland and Ulster star Craig Gilroy, who was not involved in the trial, has been disciplined for sending one of the offensive messages that was outlined to the court.
He had already been made unavailable for selection and will now face a further two-week suspension.
A statement from the governing bodies said: "Following a review of a text message sent by Craig Gilroy, the Irish Rugby Football Union and Ulster Rugby have sanctioned him, following a disciplinary process in accordance with the terms of his contract. Craig will be unavailable for team selection until 26th April 2018."

Euroleague Round 26 betting tips from Bettingpro.com's expert, including the best bets from Maccabi FOX Tel Aviv vs Anadolu Efes and AX Armani Exchange Olimpia Milano vs Olympiacos Piraeus.
Maccabi FOX Tel Aviv vs Anadolu Efes Istanbul (19:05 GMT on Thursday)
Anadolu Efes could clinch a play-off ticket if they beat Maccabi Tel Aviv but the hosts are also determined to pick up this win for a chance to barge into the play-offs zone. Efes (16-9) are currently ranked fourth in the team standings. They walloped Barcelona Lassa 92-70 at home last week. They have won three of their last four games in this competition but have dropped their last three games on the road. The spotlight is on Shane Larkin, who erupted for a career-high 37 points against Barcelona that earned him Round 25 MVP honours. Adrien Moerman is also out to impress after posting 22 points and 10 rebounds in their last Euroleague outing. Larkin and Moerman are expected to get support from Rodrigue Beaubois, Vasilje Micic, Krunoslav Simon and Tibor Pleiss. Maccabi (12-13), meanwhile, are currently ranked ninth in the table. The Israeli champions are coming off a 77-70 win at Bayern Munich in the previous round. It was their second straight win in this competition. Scottie Wilbekin is Maccabi’s top gun while big men Tarik Black and Johnny O'Bryant are also expected to make an impact. Head coach Ioannis Sfairopoulos will also count on Michael Roll, DeAndre Kane and Alex Tyus. Efes beat Maccabi 90-77 in Istanbul last November 20 with Pleiss and Bryant Dunston leading the way with 14 points apiece. We expect Maccabi to emerge victorious at home.
Point Spread
Maccabi -3.5

AX Armani Exchange Olimpia Milano vs Olympiacos Piraeus (19:45 GMT on Thursday)
Olimpia Milano and Olympiacos go separate ways after their duel at the Mediolanum Forum. Both teams sport 13-12 records and are locked in a tight battle with other teams for the lower play-off seedings. Milano suffered a 101-95 loss at CSKA Moscow last week that ended their five-game winning run in this competition. Euroleague top scorer Mike James is hoping to do better against Olympiacos after being held to 13 points against CSKA. Expected to back him up in the scoring chores are James Nunnally, Vladimir Micov and Nemanja Nedovic. Olympiacos, meanwhile, posted an 89-76 win at Buducnost last week to halt a five-game skid in this competition. Georgios Printezis and Vassilis Spanoulis are the one-two punch of the Reds with support expected to come from Nigel Williams-Goss, Zach LeDay and Nikola Milutinov, who had 15 points and 12 rebounds against Buducnost. Milano handed Olympiacos an embarrassing 99-75 beating in Greece last October 19. James led the onslaught with 22 points while Nedovic scored 18 of his 20 points in the second half. We are backing Milano to win this duel.

Sainsbury’s offers £1.3bn in Argos takeover bid
Home Retail Group Argos set to be taken over by Sainsbury's TSP-141109-145343003
Published: 12:05 Tuesday 02 February 2016
Share this article
Retail giant Sainsbury’s has moved to take over Argos after tabling a £1.3bn bid.
The bid follows an approach last year, which was rejected. The supermarket giant’s offer for Home Retail Group - Argos’ owner - is equivalent to 161.3p per share.
Sainsbury expect the joining of the two companies to result in £120M in annual savings by 2019.
More importantly, it will strengthen the supermarket’s online presence as well as its ability to compete with rival traditional retailers - to “create a food and non-food retailer of choice for customers”.
However, any deal will depend on the finalisation of the sale of Homebase to Australian company Wesfarmers. The sale of the DIY chain has already been agreed, for £340m.
Sainsbury’s chief financial officer John Rogers said he was confident that shareholders of both Sainsbury’s and Home Retail would be in favour of the Argos deal.
The £120m in savings per year was also a “conservative” figure, he added.
It is expected that Sainsbury’s can offset £140m costs in the first three years by moving Argos stores into supermarkets when their leases expire. There will also be the opportunity to sell Sainsbury’s own-brand clothing and homeware throughout Argos’ 734 outlets.

BULLS SWOOP IN FOR STAR THREE QUARTER - RHYS EVANS
Bradford Bulls are pleased to announce the signing of former Super League utility-back, Rhys Evans until the end of 2019.
The six-foot back came through the ranks at Warrington Wolves Academy, where he learnt his trade to become a top-flight player.
Making his debut for the Cheshire based side in 2010, the Welsh-International went on loan across the Championship as a youngster, gaining valuable experience, before picking up over 100 appearances for the Wolves.
John Kear spoke is his delight, capturing the former Super League star: “I’m really pleased that we have brought Rhys on board, he is someone that I myself have admired as a player for many years.
“With his introduction, there’s going to be even further competition for places in an extremely impressive three-quarter line.
“He brings a lot of experience to the side and we know from his career history that he is going to be a menace in the Championship.
“Rhys is just another important piece to the growing jigsaw puzzle here at Bradford, and we can’t wait to see what he can offer the club.”

Chinnor Cement Works
In 1908, Mr William Elijah Benton a mining engineer from Acton, founded a small business to manufacture lime on the southern edge of Chinnor. This eventually consisted of five Beehive Lime Kilns producing lump lime for use in both construction and agriculture. In 1919 he added a small cement plant which used Flare Kilns (that had to be loaded and unloaded by hand).
By 1928 the business had grown and the first rotary kiln was commissioned and following progress and development, the Chinnor Cement & Lime Co. Ltd was formed in 1936 and further investment followed, with kiln No.2 being installed in 1938. A further kiln No.3 was added in 1958 and the Company had also grown, becoming Chinnor Industries Ltd; by 1962, the original rotary kiln had been replaced by a new No.1 inclined rotary kiln and the site extended to almost 200 acres. On 1 January 1963 the ordinary shares were acquired by Rugby Portland Cement and the plant became one of only six major cement factories operated around the UK.
In latter days, with its 175 ft. high concrete chimneys as landmarks, the factory could be seen from far over the Vale of Aylesbury. Chalk, which was the main raw material, was being quarried at the amazing rate of 400,000 tonnes a year to make 225,000 tonnes of cement. The output of the factory was distributed in a fleet of tangerine-painted bulk delivery road vehicles. But it was the inward coal and gypsum traffic that also fed the thriving Chinnor Cement Works, that so fortunately saved the branch from being lifted after its passenger services had ceased in 1957. The heritage line of today is thankful that it happened, for without such traffic, there would be no CPRR now! For example in 1979 over 76,000 tonnes of these minerals were passing over the branch annually: 61,000 tonnes of coal, arriving as washed slack from Bolsover Colliery in Derbyshire, was moved in 3,900 wagons of 16 or 24 tonnes capacity (the fuel fired the inclined rotary kilns at 2,650 deg. F); 15,000 tonnes of crushed gypsum rock (sulphate of lime) came from shallow mines at East Leake near Nottingham and were moved in 1,000 wagons (gypsum is used as an additive that retards the setting rate of the cement).
But changes within the construction and minerals industries meant that things could not continue and the factory ceased production in 2000. The buildings and kilns remained in a derelict state until, in 2006, the land was purchased by Taylor Wimpey for longer term redevelopment as housing. The works were finally demolished in 2007/8 and the only remaining building is a Grade 2 listed Beehive Kiln, dating from the earliest years (built 1908).
Social comment: There was once an old adage or country-folk saying that train and time wait for no man, but William Elijah Benton, founder of Chinnor Cement Works, a frequent passenger on the Chinnor branch, was probably one exception. He had the habit of announcing his train journeys by whistling from his office door across to the station and be it noted, no train driver dared to leave without him. Norman Molyneux Benton, who succeeded his father as Chairman & Managing Director, was wont to arrive at the booking office window and say ‘my piece of cardboard please’; his destination was always made known to the station staff in advance.

And Katie Holmes appeared to be enjoying some quality time with her daughter Suri Cruise as the pair went on a walk in New York on Thursday morning.
The 40-year-old actress rocked a long denim coat and Adidas trainers amid reports that Katie and longtime beau Jamie Foxx have called it quits after he declared himself 'single' at an Oscars after-party in February.

Katie Holmes was seen in New York City on Thursday in a long denim coat, a pair of jeans, red-and-white striped Adidas trainers and a gray, rainbow lightening bolt sweater peeking out from underneath her topper.
We love the classic silhouette and neutral gray of this sweater, along with the asymmetrical vibrant-hued bolt that stretches from one shoulder to the opposite hip. Katie's sweater is by Madeleine Thompson, specifically the Styx sweater. And, fortunately for all of us, we can get it now at Harrods. Click to the right if you must have it.
We love the whimsical lightening bolt pattern and happily discovered it available on line from several designers, including A.L.C., Zadig & Voltaire and even Express. See our roundup below to get Katie's look asap.

Katie's boyfriend of nearly six years, Jamie Foxx, may have alluded to a split earlier this year, and the couple have yet to be seen together since his relationship comments.
The actor was said to have described himself as 'single' while performing at the Entertainment Studios Gala Supporting Children's Hospital in Los Angeles last month.
A source told US Weekly: 'It was very nonchalant, while he was referring to married and single couples, he just dropped the line, "I'm single."'
Classic: Ever the fashionista, Suri, 12, rocked a navy blue Dolce and Gabbana coat paired with bright pink slacks and silver ballet slippers
An insider told Entertainment Tonight last year that Jamie and Katie have a somewhat unconventional relationship.
'It’s not uncommon for them to go long stretches without seeing each other,' the source said. 'And they’re still very, very private. You’re not going to hear or see every time they’re together because they don’t flaunt their relationship in public.
Despite relationship challenges, Katie has a full schedule with three films in post-production, including The Boy 2, The Secret and Coda.

A professional skateboarder has claimed that damage to ramps at Exmouth skate park has been caused by council neglect rather than vandalism.
East Devon District Council said earlier this month that people have been 'determined to ruin others' enjoyment' of the facility in Phear Park.
But pro skater and Exmouth resident Graham Hill claims that holes in the ramps have been created by rotting wood.
He also said that the council's repair work had made the ramps even more dangerous.
EDDC said that it is in the process of replacing some rotten side panels but the running surface is safe.
The council added that it will also be looking at the rolling maintenance program for the whole skate park.

"The skate park has been there for five years now and over its expected life-span parts of the structure need to be replaced," said Graham, who runs Rule 1 Skateshop in the town and separate skating company Scuk skateboards.
"Holes are caused by the surface of the ramps starting to wear away.
"The supporting structure of the ramps has rotted leaving the Skatelite surface below vulnerable to holes as it is not designed to support that sort of weight.
"Also, once it gets wet it breaks down and acts like cardboard.
"The temporary repairs are actually making the ramp more dangerous as metal has been screwed over the holes making the surface like a cheesegrater.
"Once the Skatelite surface gets wet there is no point in repairing it as it needs to be replaced.
"The park has gone downhill quickly over the last 12 to 18 months. The repairs have got worse and worse with gaffer tape even being used - you couldn't imagine a worse repair than that.

"It's like trying to plaster over a cut that needs stitching."
A spokesman for East Devon District Council said: "We find it very sad that in the middle of the summer holidays, there are people who are determined to ruin other people’s enjoyment of Exmouth skate park.
"Our play inspector has temporarily repaired a hole created by vandals in the running surface of the half pipe, which will then have a metal plate fixed over it tomorrow.
"We are doing our best to keep the skate park safe for use and open, but it is getting harder and harder when the repairs themselves are being vandalised
"Removing damaged equipment instead of repairing it is the last thing we want to do but we can’t afford to keep on replacing the Skatelite panels, which cost £250 each plus £30 of stainless steel screws and the inspector’s time to carry out the work.
"So please could local residents be vigilant and report any acts of vandalism immediately to us and the police and help us keep this much enjoyed public amenity open for use."

IKEA Malm drawers won’t be recalled despite toddler deaths
IKEA Malm drawers
Published: 10:37 Wednesday 29 June 2016
Share this article
One of IKEA’s most popular cabinets will not be recalled in the UK and Ireland despite being involved in the deaths of three toddlers in the USA.
The Swedish furniture store has confirmed that while they will be recalling millions of the Malm drawers in America, they will still continue to sell the product in the UK and Ireland.
A spokesperson for IKEA said: “To confirm, we are not recalling any chest of drawers in the UK and Ireland.
“Today, IKEA US and IKEA Canada will launch a local recall of chests of drawers in North America only. The recall is based on the local voluntary ASTM standard, which is applicable in North America. IKEA chests of drawers meet all mandatory stability requirements on all markets where sold.”
Child deaths:
The US recall was announced on Monday following the death of 22-month-old Ted McGee who was crushed to death when the Malm drawers fell on top of him.
McGee is the third US toddler to have died in an accident involving the Malm drawers. In Feburary 2014 Curren Collas from Pennsylvania was crushed by the drawers, followed three months later by a 23 month old boy in Washington.
IKEA have issued a statement about the safety of the drawers urging parents to follow the instruction manual carefully and to ensure they anchor the drawers to the wall.
‘Drawers are safe’
A spokesperson said: “IKEA chests of drawers are safe when anchored to the wall per the assembly instruction, using the tip over restraint provided with the product. Accidents related to furniture tipping over is a serious home safety issue for the entire home furnishing industry and IKEA is committed to take the lead in addressing this challenge.”
Mum of two, Kellie Curtis, criticised the store not flagging up the risks associated with leaving the drawers free-standing after her daughter Evie-Mai was rushed to hospital when the drawers fell on top of her.
She said: “This has put me off IKEA for good and I think that they need to make the drawers safer. I really want to stress that they really do need to be fixed to the wall to avoid something like this happening.”

Norwich speedway great Ove Fundin has spoken passionately about the sport he loved - and the English city he called home.

Ove Fundin with his world championship trophy, and Golden Helmet Match Race Champions Trophy - with mechanic Les Mullins at Norwich Speedway stadium in 1960 Picture: Archant
The five-time world champion is happily retired in his native Sweden nowadays, but he served Norwich Stars with distinction – and more – between 1955 and 1964, when the club disbanded.
“I didn’t speak hardly any English at all,” he said. “I could say thank you and a few little things. But everyone was so helpful to me. Everyone was kind and nice so I very much liked it.
“For all the time I rode there with the club, I felt Norwich was my home. Now I live in Tranas, which is my home again, but Norwich is my second home and I go there at least a couple of times a year.”
The 85-year-old, nicknamed the Flying Fox, was speaking to a team from Influx – Adrian Flux’s online motoring magazine – for a film produced by WXVE, the film arm of the King’s Lynn-based Maze Media Group.

Fundin’s memories of his time in Norfolk are vivid – and he was grateful that the city had a business that helped satisfy his sweet tooth.
“I’m still grateful for the days when the chocolate factory was in Norwich, or part of it anyway,” he said. “Some of my girl supporters used to bring me lots of chocolate as I’m one of them chocaholics!”
Fundin’s love affair with Norwich came about after a chance meeting.
“After the 1954 world final at Wembley I was contacted and offered a season in Australia, which I took of course,” he explained.

“It was nice to see that part of the world. On the boat back there was a whole gang of speedway riders. All of the good riders went there and most of them were Australians who just went home to race, like I did. Among them was a guy called Aub Lawson – a very good Australian speedway rider. He had taken a liking to me and even without me knowing he had contacted his club in England, which was Norwich. He said, ‘I’ve got this fella, this Swedish guy, and maybe we should offer him a place in the team’.
“When we docked there was someone there to meet us and they offered me a spot in the Norwich team.
“It was tough racing and different kind of tracks. Once you could master all of them you did become a good rider. There was some very good riders. We had one in Norwich called Billy Bales. He was unbeatable around Norwich but he just couldn’t get around anywhere else.”
Fundin led the Norwich Stars until 1964, when the gates were locked at The Firs track.

“It really upset me when it closed,” he said. “I was very sad. I still cannot understand why they closed it. They had a very good crowd and they earned good money. What was wrong was there were five, six or maybe seven directors who owned part of it and I do know at least a couple of them were quite greedy and when they were offered good money for the land they thought they better take it now.
“I wasn’t the only one who was sad. So many of the supporters were very, very sad. I almost lost my interest when it closed. I was talked into trying another couple of clubs but my heart was never with them - it was only with Norwich. After them years there, having befriended so many people, it felt very bad.”
The interview with Fundin was conducted by speedway expert, Gavin Caney. The inspiration came from the co-founder of WXVE and Maze Media Group director Nick Curtis. The film is in memory of Nick’s grandfather, David Neeve. After he passed away, Nick discovered his love for Ove and speedway after going through his farming diaries where he wrote several entries about Fundin.

An Aberdeen FC charity group has been given the royal seal approval after receiving an award for its work.
Aberdeen Football Club Community Trust (AFCCT) received the highest honour available to volunteer groups during a ceremony at Pittodrie.
Presented by Lord Provost of Aberdeen Barney Crockett, the team were given the prestigious Queen’s Award for Voluntary Services in recognition of their work with north-east communities.
The award, created by the monarch to mark the Golden Jubilee in 2002, recognises outstanding contributions made to communities by groups of volunteers.
Mr Crockett said: “Congratulations to everyone at AFCCT on receiving the Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service.
“It is testament to the dedication, enthusiasm and sheer hard work of all involved which has led to such prestigious recognition.
“We are very fortunate in Aberdeen to have so many individuals who give up so much of their own time for the benefit of others.
“They should be proud of themselves and the work they do as part of AFCCT in helping enrich the lives of others in communities across the city and beyond.”
Youth ambassador Caitlyn Irvine, of Tillydrone, joined Mr Crockett at the ceremony.
She said: “I was so proud when I found out we had won this award and very proud of all the volunteers for the hard work they’ve put in to make this award possible.
“The trust has not only given me confidence but I’ve made friends for life.”

Overview Contact Map
Cafe Koha Description
Set in the heart of London's theatre land, just off the Charing Cross Road in St Martin's Court, is a small restaurant where you can sample a really special type of hospitality. The Albanians are famous for it; when you are under the roof of Albanians you become the most important person in the world. Nothing is too much trouble.
KOHA is owned by two Albanians from Kosova. Enis Havolli and Fadil Maqedonci, students of architecture and interior design, came to London when war erupted in Yugoslavia. They learned their present trade by working for 6 years in some of the finest restaurants in town,
and they were quick to realise that-as Albanians-they had a very special aptitude for the hospitality business.
Enis and Fadil opened KOHA in 1995, first as a bar, then as a restaurant a year later. Their idea was to put their six years of restaurant experience to the best possible use. It wasn't long before they gained a special reputation for excellent food and unique hospitality. Now, KOHA has become the well-known haunt of some of London's most interesting communities of artists, journalists, sportsmen, politicians, as well as passers-by who stumble accidentally and fortuitously into a very special environment.
The staff, are young, smart, efficient-and good looking! Below-stairs there is a romantic bar, which makes an ideal place for young people to meet at the end of the day. Upstairs, the restaurant is open for lunches and dinners, pre- and after-theatre. Special events, too, can be catered for: weddings, parties, club-luncheons...

“I have been eating at CAFE KOHA for at least six years. In the past i concidered it one of the nicest, and intimate places to eat in central london, top of my recommendation list. On a recent visit, to my horror i discovered that the Cafe has been extended, the walls painted yellow and all of its charm lost. The food was still up to its excellent standard but the serving staff seemed to be stretched by the extra tables, as was the kitchen. It is such a shame to see a previously reliable and very special place to eat changed into a something that appears more like a 'pasta house' type chain cafe. I have not been back, sorry Koha, thanks for the memories.”

“Encouraged by the reviews on this site and my own two brief visits there, I called and booked the downstairs area for my boyfriend's 40th. 4 weeks later i called back to confirm numbers. I was told that my booking had not been considered 'genuine' as I hadn't sent in a cheque. The problem was, no-one had asked me to. I was also told that no one felt it necessary to call me and ask me where my cheque was or query my booking. I was also told another lady wanted the room, and had promised to bring 60 people. As they couldn't accomodate my party as well as hers, unless I could up my numbers, I would loose the booking. I was told, very politely, 'madam, business is business'. I have been completely screwed by this venue. I am currently frantically searching for another venue to have my boyfriend's 40th party, complete with a confirmed and paid for belly dancer. my experience of Cafe Koha is that they are untrustworthy and not very customer friendly! i was promised a call from the manager to 'sort out' the mess. As yet no one has called....”

Meral Bajrami, London (12 years 7 months 8 days ago)
“I often pop into Cafe Koha in the evening for a glass of wine and some olives and always have a pleasant time. In March I had a private party downstairs and cannot praise the staff enough for their help in setting up the equipment (there was live music) and for ensuring that the evening ran smoothly. My guests were impressed with the surroundings and a good time was had by all. Thank you Cafe Koha.”

“Hello from Malta, i visited Cafe Koha last week with an Albanian friend from korce, it was a nice experience and thanks for the beer you gave us Shaban (birra Tirana). Next time if i visit London again i hope you have Albanian wine available, and also employ some Albanian waitresess, regards from Malta, Charles Borg.”

NHL close to Winter Olympic participation decision

The deputy commissioner for the National Hockey League, Bill Daly, has revealed that a decision on participation for the 2018 Winter Olympics in imminent.
Daly admitted that meetings to discuss the pros and cons of the decision are over and more will be held after the Sochi Games to make a final call.
"I do not anticipate it will take that long and we will have a broader discussion with the players' association on international competition and what we are doing internationally," Daly told reporters at Bolshoy Ice Dome.
"That discussion is underway so I would anticipate a quick resolution in respect to the Olympics, maybe six months."
Daly admitted that there are "a lot of negatives" that come with sending players away mid-season to the Olympics but did give praise for the nature of the world-class competition.
Whispers had started that a World Cup format could return, which could be a serious source of income for the league but a number of players have insisted that they want to continue competing in the Games.
"I would love another chance, I'll tell you that," Team Canada forward John Tavares said to reporters.
"The Olympic Games is obviously a pinnacle of sports and it represents a lot. Certainly there are some tough challenges with it, being involved with the PA as much as I have I know this wasn't an easy process. But we feel as players it's important and we love to play, we love to represent our countries."
An agreement for participation in Sochi between the NHL, NHLPA, IIHF and IOC wasn't reached until last summer and further issues are expected for PyeongChang in 2018.

Brighouse Town Ladies gear up for biggest match in their history
Brighouse Town Ladies hope to give a big boost to women's sport
Published: 11:00 Saturday 04 February 2017
Share this article
They are one of the biggest success stories of women’s sport in Calderdale and this weekend, they will face the biggest test in their history.
Excitement is building ahead of Sunday’s women’s FA Cup match between premier league team Brighouse Town Ladies and their super league opponents Everton Ladies.
Manager Rob Mitchell said it was a big moment for the team and around 40 mascots would be out on the pitch on Sunday.
“Everyone is really looking forward to it - it’s the biggest game a lot of them will have played.
“We’re really hoping people will come along to show their support.”
Annabelle Cass, 22, captains the Brighouse team.
She said: “It’s a big deal. It’s going to be a fantastic day and I hope we’ll get a really big crowd.
“It’s a great opportunity to play professional players.
“There should be a really good atmosphere and all our family and friends are coming to watch.”
And on the team’s chances of winning against the top flight Toffees, she said: “Never say never, if we play our best.
“We have some absolutely class players.”
Annabelle, who has played football since she was a young girl, says she hopes her two-and-a-half year old daughter Esme will follow in her footsteps.
She said: “It’s a great game for women to play - there’s the fitness benefits, the social side as you meet so many different people.
“It’s just a brilliant hobby to have.”
Speaking about women’s matches, Rob added: “The whole atmosphere is really good, there’s a family atmosphere.”

ON the day it was announced that Bulgaria and Romania would join the EU in January, 2007, more than 90 local companies with an interest in working with central and eastern European countries set out to understand how they could establish solid business links.
A series of presentations and case studies, organised by Cambridgeshire Chambers of Commerce at Wood Green Enterprises, Godmanchester, last week, highlighted the opportunities. Experts shared experiences of working in the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Poland.

ESRI: Lone parents better off not working because of 'extremely high childcare costs'
Thursday, July 05, 2018 - 07:02 AM
Almost one in five lone parents are better off not working due to the cost of childcare, according to the ESRI.
New research shows those who took up work after a social welfare policy change 2011 actually suffered a fall in income rather than a rise.
The report puts this down to high childcare costs and low-paid, part-time employment options.
Senior Research Officer, Dr Claire Keane, says the price of child-minders and creches is a huge factor.
Dr Keane said: "We have extremely high childcare costs compared to other OECD countries.
"So if we look and see how many lone parents are better off not working before we take these childcare costs into account, it's around 2%.
"If we move to include childcare costs, 16% of lone parents are financially better off not being in employment."
The Society of St. Vincent de Paul (SVP) said it confirms that the changes to the One Parent Family Payment introduced in 2012 were "counterproductive".
Dr Tricia Keilthy, Head of Social Justice with SVP, said, “This is the fourth report to be published in the last nine months which shows how the cuts during the crisis reduced the income of lone parents and pushed them into deeper and more persistent poverty.
"From the outset of the reforms, it was clear that the policy lacked coherence and led to the development of a complex system of supports, where eligibility depends on the age of their youngest child.”
“Since 2012, SVP has been particularly critical of the decision to abolish the features of the One Parent Family Payment which supported lone parents to take up employment and education. The ESRI research clearly shows that the cuts and changes resulted in income losses for employed lone parents.
"This is also reflected in data from the European Income and Living Conditions survey which showed that the rate of in-work poverty among lone parent increased from 9% in 2012 to just over 20% in 2016," she continued.
Dr Keilthy said the report also shows that adequate subsidies under the Affordable Childcare Scheme can improve lone parents’ access to employment and make it possible for parents to take up and increase working hours.
She said: “We fully agree with the authors of today’s report when they say labour market activation can’t occur in a vacuum.
"Changes in the benefit system need to be considered alongside other changes in childcare policies and family employment practices, the availability of social and affordable housing, and legislation relating to precarious work, minimum wage, and child maintenance.
“It is clear that the Government needs to move away from a ‘work first approach’, as it does not consider the barrier to education and training, making access to quality employment more difficult. Lone parents need decent employment opportunities that fit with the realities of everyday family life.”

Joe Duttine and Sally Carman looked a long way from their dowdy Coronation Street characters as they stepped out at glitzy ball this weekend.
The Corrie favourites, who are reportedly dating in real life, joined revellers at a 1920s Bugsy Malone themed ball in Manchester.
Sally, who plays Abi Franklin in the soap, looked stunning in a black pleated dress with a velvet drawsting evening bag. While Joe, who plays Tim Metcalfe, looked suave in a deep red velvet jacket and bow tie at the event.

Sally's wayward character recently had an ill-judged fling with recovering alcoholic Peter Barlow, while Tim is blissfully reunited with his wife Sally after she was freed from prison after being framed for money laundering, fraud and bribery.
It has been widely reported that the pair are dating in real-life but neither has commented, reports Manchester Evening News.

Salford actress Sally arrived in Weatherfield as Seb Franklin’s former drug abusing and alcoholic mum in Coronation Street in 2017.
The character won over an army of fans after landing a job as a mechanic at Kevin Webster's garage and is known for her outspoken nature and lashings of dark eyeliner, which prompted Steve McDonald to compare her to grunge rocker Courtney Love.
And Joe joined Corrie in 2013 as Tim, the father of Faye Windass who was adopted by cafe worker Anna.

Former Dublin footballer Denis Bastick has told how his painful ankle injury is playing havoc on the dance floor.
The five time All Ireland winner hung up his football boots in 2017 and relishes a challenge – but said his recurring injuries are flaring up as he dances his way into the hearts of the nation.
Denis, 37, told the Irish Sunday Mirror: “I’ve an ankle injury that’s causing me the most issues, I’ve had a couple of operations on it and I injured it back in November right before the dancing so I’ve got aches and pains which is affecting me.”
Commenting on why he agreed to feature on Dancing With The Stars whilst in pain, he said: “I still went ahead and did the show – I’m a glutton for punishment.”
The Dubliner admits the aggression needed on the pitch is a far cry from the passion needed on the dance floor.

He added: “I’d have the aggression on a football pitch but I don’t have it when it comes to dancing.
“I’m trying to bring a bit of that into the dance but it’s difficult because they’re so far apart.
“There are a lot of similarities because you have to perform, you’ve got one shot at it, you’ve got to go out and do a dance and you’re going out to win a match.
“But the big difference is when you’re going out on the football pitch you’ve twenty five years experience to fall back on and that’s what you don’t have in the dancing, you’re depending on stuff you’ve just learnt in a week.

“You don’t have that confidence of where you can go into automatic mode or cruise control where you can fall back on, I don’t have with the dancing.”
With the Dublin GAA team’s support the dad-of-two hopes he won’t hang up his dancing boots tonight as he wows the audience with the Paso Doble.
He said: “I haven’t checked the lads’ phones but they tell me they’re voting and a few of the lads are sharing on social media so I’ve great support.
“The slagging over the outfits and the tan is constant it wouldn’t be the dress code when it comes to the football.”

Everyone was saying the same thing about the RTE Orchestra on Dancing With The Stars
Wearing fake tan each week the former gaelic star says it’s payback time for enduring the smell of his wife’s tan every Saturday night.
He said: “Jody has found tan on the sheets, you know when I’d come home on a Saturday – the smell of the tan for the next 24 hours, so I’m getting my own back on Jody.”
Denis who works as a financial advisor by day admits punters on the street are more intrigued by his dancing than his football glory these days.
He added: “The glory of the football you miss it and that was a big thing for me so that’s why I took on this challenge.
“The people I bump into now say to me good luck with the dancing there’s no more ‘good luck with the football’ it’s a change all right, it just proves how popular the show is all around the country.”

Does Arsene Wenger have an abject fear of spending money? Ten things we learned about football this weekend

So that was the weekend that was, when Premier League football finally came back after a long summer of Lions, Ashes and strawberries and cream.
We asked Andy Dawson, better known as Twitter&apos;s Profanity Swan, who is fresh from live blogging Match of the Day, to pick out some of the key things he noticed on the first weekend of the new top flight season.
1) Michael Owen will never succeed as a pundit
A tour guide in a haunted bakery, maybe. A voiceover artist in a promotional film for a small Gloucester town, possibly. But a voice of authority covering ‘The Greatest League In The World’? Nah – the soporific striker is TV’s equivalent of Charlie Brown’s teacher.
2) Wenger&apos;s got the spending yips
Like a man who devours holiday brochures while simultaneously nursing an abject fear of flying, Arsene WANTS to splash all that cash, he just can’t bring himself to do it. It’s footballistical fiscal erectile dysfunction.
3) Manchester United will be okay, really
It’s bad news for everyone who assumed that David Moyes would be some kind of Mr Bean figure and that the walls of Old Trafford would begin to crumble post Fergie. They’ve got good players who know what they’re doing and it’ll all be fine.
4) Steve Bruce has got special feelings for the Special One
Jose and Brucie returned to the Premier League together yesterday, but the Hull boss didn’t seem bothered that his team lost, laughing and joking with Mourinho mid-match and praising Chelsea to the hilt afterwards. Perhaps he got Jose to sign his boob afterwards…
(Image: Clive Mason)
5) Paolo Di Canio is going too easy on his players
Banning mobile phones, mayonnaise, ketchup, ice in their fizzy pop and prematch singing led to a tame 1-0 reverse at home to Fulham. The Italian needs to toughen things up. Ban their baseball caps, crisps, car stereos and get them fitted with curfew ankle tags and the Black Cats might scrape a draw next week.
6) Wayne Rooney isn&apos;t happy
His body language at the Liberty Stadium proved this conclusively. But was it because he wants away from Old Trafford or because he’d been put in a seat that was sponsored by a popular hair-restoral service? We’ll have to wait and see…

7) Football is poorer for the absence of Michael Knighton
He might have presided over one of Carlisle United’s grimmest eras but the ball-juggling businessman is still an eccentric source of entertainment, with a collection of his poetry imminent. Anyone for ‘Ode To The Designer Of The Beautiful Butterfly’?
8) Carlisle United don&apos;t need Knighton back
The Cumbrians have got enough problems of their own, having conceded 13 goals in three league games and only avoiding bottom spot due to it being held by 10-point-handicapped Coventry. Mind you, it was the Sky Blues who won 4-0 at Carlisle on Saturday, so that might not last for long.
9) Barcelona are a decent each-way bet for La Liga
Just the six goals for them in the first half against Levante yesterday (although they worryingly added only one more after the break), these boys look good for at a top-two finish – pile your money on them now!
10) The coloured boot epidemic must end now

One of the Most Fascinating Countries
Tuesday, July 12th, 2011
Hi Lisa
I am now back from my travels in Japan – truly one of the most fascinating countries we have visited, and we were totally enamored with both the country and its people.
The rail passes were great – so easy to use and definitely good value. The train system in Japan is amazing – so efficient and a great way to get around.
Thanks so much for assisting with my booking and answering all my questions – I really appreciate it.
Best wishes
Melissa

Our garments are available in the broadest possible range of sizes, from the smallest baby clothes through Small, Medium and Large adult sizes all the way up to 3XL. To make sure you order the right size, please take a chest measurement of the person who will be wearing the garment and then use our size chart to match the measurement to the correct size. If you have any doubts, please contact us on 0208 912 1430 and a member of our Customer Service Team will help to make sure you select the right size.
Delivery Information
Our standard UK delivery time is 7-10 working days following the visuals which are being printed onto the garments being approved. We do, however, offer 24 hour dispatch on selected items and have a range of express delivery options available should the need arise. Contact our Customer Service Team on 0208 912 1430 and we’ll explain the options which are available for the items you’re ordering, and also any additional charges which may be incurred.
The standard charge for a mainland UK delivery is £10, whilst deliveries to Europe will cost £30 and the charge for deliveries to the rest of the world is £60. International deliveries generally take the same amount of time as UK deliveries, plus a period of between 3 and 7 working days depending upon where exactly in the world the order is being dispatched to. We work in partnership with leading courier and shipping services and don’t consider our job to be done until you’ve got our products safely in your possession.

Need to make amendments to your order?

Lines are open 9am-5pm, Monday to Friday, and our team will always do their best to ensure that the order you place is exactly as you’d like it to be.
Can I order blank items from logos4polos?

I am having difficulty completing my order

If your query is less urgent you can email us at [email protected], and we’ll be back in touch.
How much is UK delivery?
Delivery to any address in the UK will cost £10, and goods will be delivered 7-10 days after the order has been placed. Should you need an order to be supplied more quickly than that, please ring our Customer Service Team on 0208 912 1430 and ask about our express delivery and 24 hour dispatch options.
How long does international delivery take?
Depending upon exactly where in the world the order is being delivered to, an international delivery will take the same time as a UK delivery, plus an additional period of between 3 and 7 days.

Barkby United were comfortably beaten as in-form Lutterworth piled up the runs in the Premier Division on Saturday.
Lutterworth won the toss and batted, opening with Pickering and overseas player Marshall, and they put on 55 before Pickering was well caught in the slips by Tew, off Botting.
County player Lewis Hill then came to the crease and they put on 207 for the second wicket before Marshall was finally caught by Hollis off Sharp for a mammoth 162.
Two runs later Pickering was caught and bowled by Sharp for one, but Wilson and Hill continued to pile on the runs before Hollis had Hill caught by Percy for 85.
Wilson finished unbeaten on 62, and despite two more wickets from Morris, the hosts posted 368-7 from their 50 overs.
Tew and Botting got Barkby off to a good start, putting on 50 for the first wicket before Tew was caught for 24.
Barkby lost their second wicket when Tom Flowers was caught for five (58-2), and Botting was also caught for 29.
Steve Flowers added 31, with good contributions from Ben Silver (47) and Martin Troop (48 not out), but Barkby finished well short on 264-9.
Barkby host Kegworth on Saturday from 12.30pm, and next Thursday (July 12).
They then play a Fisher German XI at Beeby Road in a T20 match, starting at 3pm.
After the match, singer Kerry Jean will perform from 8pm until 9pm, and everyone is welcome.
Lutterworth: 368-7.
Bowling: C. Smith 10-0-87-0; L. Botting 10-2-34-1; A. Morris 10-0-64-2; C. Sharp 10-0-90-2; S. Flowers 7-0-62-0; B. Hollis 3-0-21-1.
Title rivals crack as Melton Town ease to 15th straight win
Barkby: D. Tew 24, L. Botting 29, T. Flowers 5, S. Flowers 31, C. Percy 16, B. Hollis 7, B. Silver 47, A. Morris 16, M. Troop 48*, C. Smith 8, C. Sharp 14*, Extras 19. Total: 264-9.

Max Verstappen wins in Austria in Red Bull's home race
Max Verstappen in front of the Dutch fans in Austria

Max Verstappen put aside a series of disappointments at his 'home races' to win the Austrian Grand Prix for Red Bull Racing.
Capitalising on Mercedes' failures at the Red Bull Ring, Verstappen claimed his first race win of the season in front of a largely Dutch fanbase.
"This feels good!" he shouted over the team radio as he crossed the line.
"It was hard to manage the tyees, and hard to hold on until the end but it was incredible to win in front of the Dutch fans here at the Red Bull Ring.
"I hope we can continue like this now."
It wasn't all rosy for Red Bull though, as they lost Daniel Ricciardo midway through the race with an electronics problem.

Sebastian Vettel, who finished third, took over the championship lead after Lewis Hamilton retired.

Common medical myth busted

A DAILY aspirin will not lower the risk of death or heart attacks in healthy older people but will increase the risk of internal bleeding, a major Australian-American study has found.
The landmark study involving more than 19,000 people aged over 70 has shown that taking a low dose (100mg) of aspirin every day will not prolong life or prevent disability, despite common beliefs the pill helps healthy seniors live longer.
Three papers published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Monday revealed the result of a seven-year study that could lead to a rethink of global guidelines relating to the use of aspirin to prevent common conditions associated with ageing.
The clinical trial did not include people who take aspirin for medical reasons as advised by their doctor, including those who have already suffered a heart attack or stroke.
The study found a daily low dose of aspirin did not reduce risks of certain diseases and medical problems in older people.
Instead, it focused on answering the question of whether the drug reduced the risk of healthy seniors suffering their first heart attack or stroke, or losing their good health.
Lead author Professor John McNeil says the results are clear: "If you don't need it, don't take it."
The randomised double-blind trial, called ASPREE, was conducted by Monash University in Australia and the Berman Centre for Outcomes and Clinical Research in the United States.
Using the help of GPs, researchers recruited 16,703 older people in Australia and 2411 in the United States, with approximately 9500 people in both the aspirin and the placebo group.
The participants took a daily low-dose of aspirin every day for nearly five years, with researchers monitoring their health and any occurrences of disease, disability or death.
They found an increase in the number of cases of serious internal bleeding among the aspirin takers (3.8 per cent) compared to the placebo group (2.8 per cent).
The study found it could actually increase the risk of internal bleeding.
"There was more bleeding, particularly from the stomach and upper gastrointestinal tract," Prof McNeil told AAP.
The study also showed slightly higher rates of death in those taking aspirin, primarily from cancer, although the results were not statistically significant, he said.
The "tentative finding" required further investigation as researchers in other studies suggest aspirin may prevent cancer, he said.
Prof McNeil cautioned the findings did not apply to those with existing conditions where aspirin is recommended as a preventive measure against further heart attacks, strokes or angina.
He said anyone with questions should follow the advice of their doctor.
The ASPREE trial was funded by the US National Institutes of Health, the Australian National Health and Medical Council, Victorian Cancer Agency and Monash University.

SCOTTISH by formation, Mick Imlah was an Oxbridge critic and poet and a member of the London literary establishment. With his twin sister Fiona, he was born in Aberdeen in 1956. The Imlahs lived in Milngavie for ten years until his father, who worked in insurance, moved the family to Kent in 1966. Imlah attended Dulwich College — alma mater of PG Wodehouse and Raymond Chandler and, ahem, Nigel Farage — and won a demyship to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he taught as a Junior Fellow. Imlah also attempted a PhD, on Arthurian influences in Victorian poetry, but abandoned it. Thereafter, he was an editor, first at Oxford Poetry and later as Andrew Motion’s successor at Chatto & Windus. From 1993 onwards he was a critic at the Times Literary Supplement where most of these essays first appeared.
Imlah’s poetry is humorous, darkly brooding and provocative, and was on occasion influenced by his criticism. One can see a relationship, for instance, between his review of Walter Scott’s novels and his verse biography ‘Diehard’ or his review of Tom Leonard’s biography of James Thomson and the gloomy elegy ‘B.V’. In his early years, Imlah may have been overly meticulous with his poetry and admits, ‘… I revise, much too much. In the quest for polish or evenness you can rewrite the life out of a thing’. He produced just two collections twenty years apart; Birthmarks appeared in 1988 and The Lost Leader in 2008, after he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease and which won the Forward Prize. He died the following year.
Prefaced by his close friend Mark Ford, the essays here indicate that Imlah’s criticism and poetry are grounded in literary history and context. It is often the writer’s background that informs his opinions and leads him later to produce a stanza on their imagined histories. The editors of this volume are themselves poets and critics: André Naffis-Sahely is a translator and editor of a book of essays on Michael Hofmann and Robert Selby wrote a PhD on Imlah. Having picked the cream of Imlah’s prose, they present a triptych of his critical voice: a series of literary musings, followed by essays on rugby and cricket and ending with the poet’s own gently self-deprecating remarks in a brief interview with Oxford Poetry.
The most interesting section of the volume are the essays and reviews, selected over a ten-year period and compiled under the heading ‘On Writers’. Two dominant characteristics emerge. The first is Imlah’s revisiting of canonical figures such as Tennyson, Scott and Larkin; the second gives due praise to writers often of Scottish extraction such as Douglas Dunn, S.R. Crockett, Edwin Muir and J.M. Barrie. In these essays he explores the tensions in his own Scottish identity, describing his enthusiasm for Scots language and modernist literature while dismissing urban, working-class writing. It must also be said that each piece features a male writer; women are conspicuous by their absence. Perhaps this is an example of the ‘fraternal tenderness’ that’s mentioned in the preface.
A ‘traditional, conservative poet’ himself, Imlah admired verse which had a strong lyrical style. He remarks: ‘I’ve always liked Tennyson more than most people seem to. I don’t write like him though’. In his essay on him, he provides personal and evocative details such as Tennyson wrote ‘Crossing the Bar’ in twenty minutes as he sailed across the Solent and found landscapes ‘glimmering’ because his eyesight was so poor. Imlah points out the contrast between Tennyson’s depressive temperament and his eventual fame, adding: ‘Tennyson’s problem in presenting poems to the public was that his deepest experience was unsocial, painful, and shaming to a degree; this was no ordinary reticence.’
Imlah reviewed with kindness and flair when he fond poetry that excited him. Considering Douglas Dunn’s Dante’s Drum-Kit, for instance, he points out that the poet ‘likens his craft to gardening’. Meanwhile, in a review of Christopher Reid’s The Echoey Tunnel, he states: ‘Tidy, subtle, faintly surreal poems of a domestic character have established Christopher Reid as a master and advocate of the diminutive’. Imlah wrote extravagantly when he felt he had unearthed literary treasure. His essay on S.R. Crockett, the prolific novelist of the Kailyard school, for instance, feels unnecessarily crammed with facts about Dumfries and Galloway. ‘Not every schoolboy knows, even today, that Galloway is the long-standing name for the south-west corner of Scotland… With a coastline of smugglers’ caves, saltmarshes and mudflats fringing the Solway Firth…‘ He speaks openly of his roots and partially submerged Scottishness: ‘My family moved south from Glasgow when I was ten, so the most important part of my upbringing was English; I developed an inconspicuous accent quite quickly, though I still have the other one up my sleeve like a dirk for tight comers. I suppose I only feel Scots on major sporting occasions now. It’s not something I’d write about.’
But Imlah does write passionately about Scottishness, albeit from an expatriate perspective. In his essay ‘Auld Acquaintances’, he says: ‘It must be a healthy nationalism that can produce a volume as big-hearted as Angela Cran and James Robertson’s A Dictionary of Scottish Quotations’. However, he chides the editors for omitting what he called ‘most potent sentence of the Scottish History’ as delivered by Bonnie Prince Charlie to his forces at Ruthven after Culloden: ‘Let everyone seek his own safety the best way he can’. This could have been Imlah’s mantra. He has little patience with contemporary Scottish literature’s obsession with subculture, specifically the ramblings of marginalised males. Reviewing James Kelman’s short story collection The Good Times, he seems baffled as to why Kelman would want to write about men whiling away time in the pub: ‘His politics now seem to require that his stories should deliver the least remarkable hours of these unregarded lives’. Irvine Welsh, however, gets the sharpest slap as Imlah sees only selfishness and depravity in Ecstasy: ‘Until Irvine Welsh can extricate himself from this community and apply himself more generously to the task, his reader will feel at once put upon and excluded.’
The book closes with a brief interview. Conducted in 1983 when Imlah was twenty-eight, it reveals a clever, sometimes defensive young man offering his opinions on poetry. When asked about styles in contemporary poetry, he replies: ‘Today’s poet is a bit like a Victorian architect; there’s no single staple native style available (as, say, the heroic couplet was for Pope) so he has to choose a model for each piece of work: Middle Pointed Gothic, neo-Egyptian, blank verse, this or that kind of stanza, silly one-word lines, whatever’. If posed the same question today, perhaps he would express a different opinion. Sadly, we will never know.

Football anthem Three Lions has hit the number one spot on the Official Vodafone Big Top 40 chart following England's World Cup win against Sweden.
The track, by comedians Frank Skinner and David Baddiel with The Lightning Seeds, knocked last week's chart-topper Solo by Clean Bandit and Demi Lovato off the top spot.
The No. 1 comes 22 years after the song was released in 1996 to accompany the European Championships, which were that year held in England.
Three Lions climbed 32 places in the chart, which is separate from the Official Charts Company's weekly chart, after England beat Sweden in their quarter-final game on Saturday afternoon.
The anthemic track, which has been adopted by England fans once again for the current tournament in Russia, entered the chart last week at number 33.
Marvin Humes, presenter of the Big Top 40, said: "What an incredible day! It's only right that Three Lions is number one on the chart.
"Our boys in Russia are doing us so proud. The nation has come together and hopefully this is only the beginning of the celebrations."
The Official Vodafone Big Top 40, produced by Global, is said to be the only chart that reflects consumption of music in the UK in real time.
On Friday, the Official Charts Company revealed that Three Lions had re-entered its own top 40 for the first time since the 2014 World Cup.
The track is currently at No.24 after a surge in streaming from England fans.

Indianapolis Colts
O Indianapolis Colts é um time profissional de futebol americano localizado em Indianápolis, Indiana, Estados Unidos. Eles são membros da Divisão Sul da American Football Conference (AFC) na National Football League (NFL).
O clube foi fundado oficialmente em Baltimore, Maryland em 1953, mas sua história data do Dayton Triangles, um dos times fundadores da NFL criado em 1913. Após uma série de mudanças, o time passou a se chamar Baltimore Colts na decada de 50. Jogando no antigo Memorial Stadium, os Colts foram o primeiro time da NFL ter oficialmente um grupo de cheerleaders e uma banda marcial, copiando o futebol americano universitário. O time então se mudaria para Indianápolis em 1984, jogando primeiro no Hoosier Dome, rebatizado de RCA Dome, e então indo para uma nova arena, o Lucas Oil Stadium, inaugurada em 2008.
Os Colts venceram quatro campeonatos da NFL (três NFL Championships em 1958, 1959, 1968; e o Super Bowl V em 1971) enquanto ainda jogavam em Baltimore. Depois que se mudaram para Indianapolis, o time foi campeão do Super Bowl XLI em 2007. Desde 1998, o time se tornou o único time na história da NFL a vencer 12 ou mais partidas em sete temporadas consecutivas, sendo que este recorde foi estendido para sete temporadas em 2009. Os Colts também foram o primeiro time na NFL a vencer todos os outros 31 times da liga em temporada regular.[1] O Quartel-general do time e as instalações de treinamento estão localizadas em Indianápolis. O time faz seu training camp anual entre julho e agosto no campus da Universidade de Anderson em Anderson, Indiana.

A 71-year-old man has died following a major crash on the A30 in East Devon on Friday.
Police are searching for anyone who may have witnessed the man's vehicle leave the road and end up on its roof near Yarcombe around 7.13pm.
The road was closed in both directions for several hours following the crash, which saw a red Honda Prelude leave the road and collide with crash barriers, Devon Live reports.
The fatal crash took place just before 7.15pm outside Higher Colyforches Farm. (Image: Google)
Highways England joined emergency services on the scene and helped to put diversions in place.
Weather conditions at the time of the crash were dry and fine and visibility was good.
The man's dog is understood to have survived the crash.
Anyone who witnessed the crash or may have any information about what happened is asked to 101 quoting log number 922 of July 6.

Petrol attendants caught with variety of street drugs
By Staff Reporter - 17 February 2019 - 16:20
Drugs seized in Durban North
Image: SAPS
Police in Durban North have arrested two petrol attendants for possession of dagga, CAT and ecstasy - in one of several big busts over the weekend.
The duo, aged aged 31 and 37, are suspected of dealing in the "Swazi Gold" and other drugs.
Police said they were found in possession of packed parcels and loose dagga on Saturday. "The officers went to their lockers where more dagga including CAT and ecstasy were found."
The total street value of the recovered drugs at the service station was R10,400.
"On further investigation, the police officers arrested a 23-year-old suspect who is believed to be the one who was delivering dagga to these dealers.
"Quick-thinking police officers waited for him to arrive at the service station to deliver the drugs and he was arrested on arrival."
In a follow-up operation, the police officers went to Mangweni in Inanda, where a house was searched.
Dagga weighing 28.5kg, with a street value of R350,000, was seized.
A 55-year-old man was arrested at the property for dealing in drugs.
Police said: "It is believed that the dagga was coming from Swaziland and transported to Inanda and surroundings."
All the arrested suspects are expected to appear in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court on Monday.

In another bust, Western Cape police on Friday found a large amount of drugs at a house in Rocklands.
"Inside the house members found 100 grams of tik, 17 grams of crushed mandrax tablets, 15 grams of tik, 18 grams of crushed mandrax, 60 mandrax tablets, one straw of mandrax, 65 large plastic packets of tik, 43 small plastic packets of tik, one large plastic packet of tik, 79 plastic packets of rocks, and one plastic packet of crushed mandrax," said police.
The drugs have an estimated street value of about R60,000.
A man was arrested and will appear in the Mitchells Plain Magistrate’s Court on Monday, on charges relating to possession of drugs.
King William's Town Flying Squad members also made a big bust of drugs being sold at a house.
At the house at Zone 3, Zwelitsha, several bags of dagga were found hidden behind the beds and seized.
The dagga weighed in at 29.5 kg with a street value of approximately R10,000. Two suspects aged 48 and 50 years were arrested and face charges of possession of dagga.

As part of the police's #drugsoffthestreet campaign, several busts have taken place recently.
In another operation in the Eastern Cape, police seized an unlicensed firearm, dagga and tik. Two men aged 37 and 42 were arrested. Both suspects will appear before the Ngcobo Magistrate's Court on Monday.
And late last week, Crime Intelligence members, together with the Umhlali K9 Unit, conducted an operation at Melville, KwaDukuza. Capsules containing whoonga were seized. A 32-year-old suspect was arrested in this operation.
KZN officers attached to the Drug and Firearm Unit also bust a suspect for drug dealing in Cele Road, Lamontville, last week. They confiscated 222 capsules of heroin and 180 pieces of rock cocaine, as well as cash.

What do our website fee bands mean?
All of the speakers and artists featured on the website are classified within a specific fee range (e.g. E: £3K - £5K). This does not mean the speaker's actual fee will vary between these parameters. Instead, it is an indication that the fee is expected to fall somewhere within that range.
Some speakers may be listed as POA as they deliver a wide range of activities, which may mean that their fees are subject to greater variability depending on the requirements of our clients.
Fee bands are intended as an indication for corporate or private engagements and standard appearances to help you determine which speakers or artists are most likely to fall within your budget. These guides are based largely on our knowledge of the industry and that gained from previous bookings.
Please also note that these fees do not include VAT or expenses, and a firm fee can only be determined having approached speakers with a specific enquiry and full event brief. For the most up-to-date information, please contact a member of the Speakers Corner team, who will be happy to help.

Hylton Sports Club ended their inaugural season in style on Saturday, winning the Mark Blake Memorial Trophy final.
Hylton edged out city rivals Hall Farm Glasshus 4-3 in a thrilling final at Nissan.
Man of the match Michael Kennedy, Marc Moon, Corey Bell and Jack Curry did the damage for Hylton, with Lee Pearce, star man Carl Burns and Adam Elliott replying.
The Durham Alliance Combination League closes on Wednesday night when Hall Farm Glasshus have another crack at silverware, taking on Horden Community Welfare in the League Challenge Cup final, back at Nissan (7.30pm).
Hall Farm beat Horden 3-2 in last week’s Washington Aged Peoples Trophy final.
* Northern League club Stockton Town lost out on the big stage yesterday, as they succumbed to a 1-0 defeat to Thatcham Town in the Buildbase FA Vase final at Wembley
Hellenic League champions Thatcham started the game well with a couple of chances from Ekow Elliott, but Stockton keeper Michael Arthur made some fine saves.
The deadlock was broken in the 23rd minute, when Thatcham took the lead with a penalty scored by Shane Cooper-Clark, with Arthur narrowly missing out on making a save, getting a hand to the ball. It was Cooper-Clark’s 62nd goal of a prolific season.
The spot-kick was awarded when Jordan Brown broke past two men before being fouled by James Ward.
Early in the second half, Stockton had a great chance to level, but Fred Woodhouse’s effort was blocked by Thatcham defender Babourcarr Jarra.
Dale Mulligan headed over with another opportunity.
In the fourth minute of stoppage time, Thatcham cleared off the line following a corner which saw Arthur go up to challenge.
Thatcham broke clear following their narrow escape and sub Ross Cook took the ball towards an empty net, only for an incredible sliding tackle from Matthew Garbutt to keep the score at 1-0.

Ballarat's good men of the cloth
June 14, 2002 — 10.00am
Normal text size
Larger text size
Very large text size
It was a triumphant homecoming. The tall, gangly figure, once a sickly youngster, was back with credentials that marked him for greatness. At 30, George Pell had not only proved his sporting prowess, trying out for champion football team Richmond, but had been to Rome, and earned an Oxford doctorate. It was a combination that made the young Father Pell a glittering prize when he returned to the Ballarat diocese in 1971.
In those days, priests, especially in Ballarat, the most devout of Victoria's four dioceses, were all-powerful, and Pell, who would go on to be archbishop of Melbourne and then Sydney, was not only a priest, but a priest blooded in Rome. Few doubted he was a prince of the church in the making.

But as he went about his first Australian appointment, the diocese in which he had grown up, and to which he was returning, had much to hide. While Pell prepared to hear confessions in Swan Hill, some of his colleagues in the diocese were sexually molesting young boys in the classrooms of East Ballarat's St Alipius primary school. In 1971, the year Pell returned from Oxford, a disturbing number of the school's male personnel were paedophiles. Indeed, they were part of a flowering paedophile ring that would go unchecked by the church for more than 20 years. By the time the church faced up to it, hundreds of lives would lay in ruins, a policeman who tried to break up the ring would be out of a job, and Pell would insist that he knew nothing of the abuse until it was too late.
The story of the gifted archbishop and the gutter lives of Ballarat's paedophile priests and brothers is a study in contrasts. It is not just that Ballarat, built around the old gold mining town, is - according to current bishop Peter Connors - probably the worst of Australia's 32 dioceses for sexual abuse. It is also that while Pell came back from overseas full of moral entreaties, men he knew, serial child abusers such as Father Gerald Ridsdale, denied the faith by systematically sodomising young boys.
The pattern continued for decades. As Pell rose through the ranks, due in part to his tough, conservative moral stance on sex and schooling, his Ballarat colleagues talked saintly and behaved sadistically. And through it all, the church went on placing criminal clergy where they could prey on children, while at the same time frustrating police inquiries and persuading complaining families to remain silent.
It was the kind of hypocrisy and manipulation that can, and did, drive victims and their families to the edge, and over it. Pell, who was never bishop of Ballarat, says he did not know the extent of Ridsdale's evil until the priest was first put on trial in early 1993, although he said yesterday he "did hear rumours about the time Ridsdale returned from treatment in the USA in 1990".
And it is true that Pell, whose first job in 1971 was as an assistant priest in Swan Hill (still in the Ballarat diocese), was a fair way from St Alipius when Ridsdale became the school's chaplain. But the two men were familiar. Though separated by seven years, both attended St Patrick's College in Ballarat. Their families knew each other, and for a year they shared a house. Both went to Corpus Christi seminary, though at different times.
Ridsdale - who was finally jailed for a minimum of 15 years in 1994 after pleading guilty to 46 counts of sexual offences committed over two decades on 21 victims - arrived at St Alipius from Warrnambool after a decade in the priesthood. He was older than Pell, and having left school early, did not have the academic sparkle of the younger man. Like his sister Shirley, he was born in St Arnaud, 245 kilometres north-west of Melbourne, but grew up in Ballarat and, like Pell, returned to the diocese for his first job. A tall, big-boned man, often seen as jovial and extroverted, he was a popular figure when he returned in 1971. No one knew it at the time, but he was a confirmed paedophile.
At the four-classroom St Alipius he found like company. Brother Robert Best, who taught grade 6, Brother Edward Dowlan, who taught grade 5, and another brother, Fitzgerald, now dead, were all paedophiles. So was former Christian Brother Stephen Francis Farrell. All, except Fitzgerald, were later convicted of sex crimes. During Dowlan's County Court trial in 1996, the prosecution alleged that three St Alipius boys were each sexually abused by Dowlan, Best and Ridsdale.
"Derek" said he was assaulted by Dowlan in grade 5in 1971, by Best in 1971-72 and by Ridsdale at the church in 1972, while he was making his confession to the priest. Last week, "Derek" revealed he had been paid $200,000 and asked to sign a confidentiality clause as part of a compensation payout from the church.
"Stephen" said he was assaulted many times by Best in grade 6 in 1973, and by Dowlan and Ridsdale. Now aged 40, and happy to have his name used, that boy, Stephen Woods, says it was a brutal time for the boys at the school.
"The culture was one of incredible violence," he says. He says he was raped by Ridsdale after the priest was no longer chaplain at the school. It was 1975 and 14-year-old Stephen knocked on the door of St Patrick's cathedral presbytery, the imposing building where Ballarat bishop Ronald Mulkearns had an office. He asked to see a priest and was introduced to Ridsdale. "Straight away he started molesting me," Stephen says. "He took me to a toilet at Lake Wendouree and raped me."
From the toilet, Stephen could glimpse the 15-room bluestone mansion that was the official residence of Ballarat's bishop. It sat on 1.3 hectares on the west, or Adelaide, side of town. On the east, or Melbourne side, was St Alipius, and the flat land where the gold miners settled and built shanties, pubs and brothels. It was not salubrious, but it was where Ridsdale lived.
In 1973 Pell joined him, and several other priests, in a house just one door from St Alipius. Pell never worked at the school: his new post of vicar for education for the diocese was not an executive one. His main task was chairing the board that advised on school policy.
Pell says he strove to work amicably with his brother priests, but was never close friends with Ridsdale. "I lived there with him and there was not even a whisper," Pell said later.
The church's leadership, however, did know of Ridsdale's abuse. At Ridsdale's 1994 trial, it was claimed the church had sent him to a psychologist as early as 1971 and that before arriving at Ballarat, he had been shunted around the diocese because of complaints.
Bishop Mulkearns, now retired, says that he did not know of Ridsdale's problem until 1975, when the priest was at Inglewood, a gold rush town 180 kilometres north of Melbourne. Mulkearns did not return calls yesterday, but in a letter to Shirley Mitchell in June, 1994, he said that after a parishioner had complained about Ridsdale he "immediately removed" the priest.
Like other Catholic bishops at that time and later, Mulkearns did not, however, keep the paedophile priest away from children or report him to police. After "psychological counselling", he was given a new job and he continued to offend.
Mulkearns' 1994 letter to Ridsdale's sister says: "It could, therefore be said that I was aware of a problem, but I was certainly unaware of the extent of that problem and I did endeavour to do something about it."
Like Pell, he says he had no idea of the extent of the problem until criminal charges were laid. Shirley Mitchell, who was angry with both her brother and Bishop Mulkearns, partly for the damage done to victims, her parents and family, now accepts that church leaders in the '70s just did not understand paedophilia.
Others, like victims' support group Broken Rites, however, question how Pell, who moved to the city of Ballarat in 1973, did not know, at least by 1975, when Mulkearns admits he knew that Ridsdale was a serial sex offender.
Pell says that by 1974, while he still lived in Ballarat, he spent up to two days a week working in Melbourne as director of Aquinas College, Institute of Catholic Education. He said Mass at Ballarat parish at weekends. "I was never chaplain to St Alipius Boys School or worked there," he said yesterday.
It was in late 1975, when Mulkearns moved Ridsdale from Inglewood, that the abuse first came to the notice of police. A Detective Sergeant Mooney was contacted by a prominent Inglewood identity whose son had allegedly been molested by Ridsdale. Inquiries were frustrated, however, when the parents would not allow their son to be interviewed and Ridsdale disappeared.
Mooney visited Mulkearns to tell him what he had learnt of Ridsdale's behaviour. The bishop said he would handle it. In fact, he moved the paedophile priest on. The abuse continued, building up to the point where, by 1995, 20 years after Mulkearns says he was first alerted, police mounted a three-month investigation - Operation Arcadia - examining the bishop's role. They concluded that "it does appear that Mulkearns has had knowledge of events as committed by Ridsdale much earlier than he suggests".
There is no doubt that a cover-up was in full swing, and it ranged to the far edges of the sprawling Ballarat diocese. It is not just that the Christian Brothers spent an estimated $400,000 defending St Alipius' paedophiles, Dowlan and Best; the diocese was shielding paedophiles as far away as Mildura, on the NSW border.
In 1971, when the St Alipius paedophile ring was taking shape and Pell had just returned, a Mildura detective, Denis Ryan, gathered 16 written statements from 14 boys and two girls detailing child abuse offences against Monsignor John Day. Day, Mildura parish priest from 1957 to 1971, died in 1978 aged 69. Ridsdale had worked with Day for two years until 1964, and was a good friend. Ryan, a veteran detective stationed at Mildura, first came across Day when, as a young constable, he arrested him in St Kilda at 2 o'clock one morning in 1956. The then Father Day was in a car with two prostitutes. He had his pants down. Day was not charged.
Ryan renewed his acquaintance with Day when a Mildura headmaster told him in 1971 that a 12-year-old girl had been indecently assaulted by the priest. It is believed that police notified Mulkearns around 1971-72 about the evidence against Day, but he was not moved, nor taken out of contact with children.
In 1997, the year Mulkearns resigned, Ryan said Day had not been charged with molesting children, despite the sworn evidence he had amassed, including that from a girl aged 14.
Ryan, a Catholic, said at the time that the case had cost him his job, his first marriage and tens of thousands of dollars in superannuation. "When it was learnt by police command that I had begun an investigation into Monsignor Day, I was instructed by some of my superiors to cease," he said. "I was also given strict instructions not to make any more inquiries. Shortly afterwards I was informed I was to be transferred to Melbourne." Ryan, who had family reasons for staying in Mildura, chose to resign rather than leave.
Dr Pell said yesterday that although they were in the same diocese, he was not aware of Day's activities except that he heard some gossip about him in the 1970s "which was fiercely rejected by many".
But in a 1997 letter to parishioners, Mildura parish moderator Father Pat Mugavin said there was evidence to support claims that Day sexually assaulted a number of children. He expressed regret and sorrow, adding, "when trust is betrayed by church leadership, we all feel betrayed and outraged".
Day was taken out of Mildura and allowed to go overseas until the heat came off. In 1972 State Parliament was told that pressure had been bought to bear, not only in the police force, but in the chief secretary's department. Les Shilton, an MLA and former detective, objected to Day being able to leave the country and called for a judicial inquiry. No inquiry was held, and Day returned to Australia to be given a new post at Timboon, near Warrnambool, the coastal town where Ridsdale had served before returning home to Ballarat.
It was like a game of musical chairs, with paedophile priests in a ring ravaging children until the music stopped, and one of them had to leave the circle. The people were kept in the dark. No one at Timboon was told why Day was moved to their parish. No warnings were issued. No one seemed concerned. Why this should be when the devastation Ridsdale and the others were wreaking was horrendous - "Derek", one of Ridsdale's victims who gave evidence in court, spoke of seeing the priest straddling one boy while the other, who was bleeding from the anus, cried - is hard to fathom.
Shirley Mitchell did not know her brother had abused one of her family until he was about to be charged in 1993. Then Ridsdale had no explanation, though he denied his paedophilia was due to celibacy. He later claimed he was sexually assaulted while a boy by, among others, a Christian brother. In his teens he became aware of his sexual leaning towards boys. It was, he told someone close to him, more about "power" than sex.
Known by some as the "poofter priest from Inglewood", Ridsdale was, in 1976, moved to a more remote parish, Edenhope, near the South Australian border. He was, his victims from that time say, still upbeat and apparently unchastened by the brush with police. Victims talk of him coming into classrooms in Edenhope and selecting boys whom he would abuse in the nearby presbytery.
"He'd lock the door. He'd offer you lollies, soft-drink, anything," one of his victims, "Andrew", told Age reporter Ian Munro in 1994.
By 1980, his behaviour was so out of control the church took him out of direct ministry and packed him off to the National Pastoral Institute in the southern Melbourne suburb of Elsternwick, where, though denied easy access to young children, he continued to offend.
Yesterday Pell said "there was nothing unusual" about Ridsdale studying at the institute. "Before 1996, Ballarat had a committee to deal with this problem of accusations of sexual abuse. I was never a member of such a committee and no allegations or reports on any of the men mentioned were made to me."
In 1981 Ridsdale was sent even further away, to Sydney, where he had a desk job. Yet he still found victims and is wanted for sex offences there.
Ridsdale's last parish appointment came in 1986 when he was posted to the town of Horsham, in Victoria's Wimmera. He is reported to have told a colleague there that his past was catching up with him. And it was. In 1988, one of the Edenhope victims made a complaint, as did a Horsham woman whose son had been molested. But still the church protected him. In 1990, the year that Pell, by now an auxiliary bishop of Melbourne diocese, was made a member of the Vatican Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith - the Vatican's doctrinal watchdog - Ridsdale was packed off to New Mexico, where he was supposedly going to be reformed. In fact, he had a nine-month holiday, during which he did "locums" for the local diocese, and sexually abused children, some of whom have confronted the American church.
Time was, however, running out. In 1992, after being appointed chaplain at St John of God hospital in Richmond, NSW, a victim phoned Operation Paradox, a Victorian police child sex abuse phone-in. Three months later he was charged.
When he made his first court appearance in 1993, Pell was by his side. "My sympathies were always with the victims," Pell said last week, adding that he "had little idea of the full extent and gravity of his (Ridsdale's) crimes". Pell now says his accompanying Ridsdale was a mistake, as it misled people about his position.
Just before the trial, Ridsdale travelled home to Ballarat to tell his family about his crimes. They were deeply shocked. He had, unbeknown to them, sexually abused some of his nephews, including David Ridsdale. David has claimed that Pell tried to silence him when he phoned him about the abuse in 1993. Pell denies this, and says, "David's claims are inconsistent, discredited and wrong".
What is not in dispute is the breadth of Ridsdale's crimes. When he told his family, one asked: "How many, Gerald. Four, or five?". He paused. "Hundreds," was his reply.

Egyptian football fans estranged by violence will finally meet in the UAE
Supporters of Al Ahly and Al Masry get to attend Egyptian Supercup match in Al Ain
Violence erupts during a football match between Al Masry and Al Ahly in Port Said city on February 1, 2012. Seventy-three people were killed and at least 1,000 injured, leading to a years-long ban on fans at Egyptian football matches. Reuters

The number 74 looms large over Egyptian football. It's on Al Ahly sporting club's sign on an island in the Nile and on black T-shirts around Egypt, the numerals filled in with the names of football fans who died six years ago in one of the most violent instances of Egypt’s revolution and of football worldwide.
It started after a game between Al Ahly, the powerhouse of Egyptian football, and Al Masry from the Suez Canal city of Port Said. As the final whistle blew, fans stormed the field. Players and fans tried to escape, but they found some gates locked shut and 74 died in stampedes or from blunt trauma. Revolutionaries thought it was orchestrated by the state, others said it was negligence.
Following the disaster, authorities banned spectators from all Egyptian league matches across the country. On Friday, those same two teams will play in front of fans for the first time since that tragic night in 2012. But it will not be in Egypt. Instead the Egyptian Supercup, played between the winners of the Egypt Cup and the Egyptian Premier League, will be decided at Hazza bin Zayed stadium in Al Ain, UAE.
Beyond the loss of life, the effects of the violence — which many in Egypt called a massacre — carried on into Egyptian football. Security decisions made it difficult to organise games. Empty stands affected television viewership. Disconnected from their fan base, Egyptian players dipped in performance level.
“We knew each other and knew a lot about each other. We’re a close community. If you don’t know someone personally, you know their face,” said Hicham El Feky, a lifelong Ahly fan who became brand manager at the club and designed the T-shirt commemorating the victims. “We lost a lot of our friends, and a lot of things were broken during that match, unfortunately. Many people lost their interest in football. It became difficult to know which teams were popular or not.”
Al Ahly and Al Masry last met in November, when Al Ahly won 2-0. But this is the first time they will play each other in front of fans.
The last decade of Hosni Mubarak’s regime was a boom time for Egyptian football, with the advent of satellite television with dedicated channels, investment from the government and international victories for Egyptian teams. Several defeats,most notably to Algeria in 2009, left fans disillusioned and then came the 2011 revolution and Port Said.
“Several events add up to this sort of breakup of this boom,” said Carl Rommel, an anthropologist who studies Egyptian football. “The massacre is the most important of these events.”
Mohamed El Erian is an Al Masry fan because of its roots in Egyptian nationalism and Port Said. The club was founded after Egypt’s 1919 revolution against the British, and its green kit symbolises the flag of that period. When Port Said was evacuated during the wars with Israel, Al Masry club games became a gathering point for the displaced, he said.
It is for that reason that merely playing before a crowd of fans is not enough for Mr El Erian.
“We will go back to our stadium in Port Said. It’s a matter of time and we believe in this — it’s our right. Even if there are some people that committed a mistake, we cannot judge all people,” he said.
Mr Rommel is not so sure. “I think it's likely that fans will return but I also have a feeling that the authorities are quite happy not allowing full stadiums,” he said.
Violence still breaks out at football matches and the authorities come down hard. A decision to ease the ban on supporters in stadiums was reversed almost immediately in February 2015, when police fired birdshot and tear gas into fans at a match between Zamalek and ENNPI in Cairo and 22 were killed. Last July, police took 236 fans into custody, claiming they had vandalised a stadium in Alexandria. More than 200, many of them hardcore fans known as Ultras, were released in December.

Ultras have a contentious relationship with the police and club leadership, and in 2015 they were banned by an Egyptian court. Graffiti, saying “ACAB”, an abbreviation for a profane anti-police slogan, and “football is for the fans” is among the most common forms of vandalism in Cairo, and is usually understood to be the work of Ultras.
International leagues require clubs to allow audiences into games, so fans have been returning slowly. But those matches have not been open to the general public, only to club delegations. There are still no fans allowed at domestic football matches.
The success of the Egyptian national team, led by superstar Mohamed Salah — recently-crowned African Player of the Year and currently top scorer in the English premiership with Liverpool — to their first time World Cup since 1990, has begun to lift football out of the doldrums. But Mr Rommel does not believe the game will regain the heights of its popularity in Egypt in the mid-2000s.
The absence of cheering supporters affects performance and memories of the revolution are long. On the other hand, Mr Rommel points out that fans and players who are around the 20 mark now were only 13 at the time of the revolution, and they may not associate football so closely with the massacre.
“Maybe we shouldn’t over-emphasise these revolutionary events of five, six years ago,” he said.
About 3,600 tickets for Friday's match have been sold in Egypt, according to Presentation Sports, the company responsible for ticketing. Abu Dhabi police have mobilised 15 security forces including anti-riot, special forces, air ambulance and canine units, and called on fans to "commit to civilised cheering and to co-operate with police forces to maintain public security."
Fans like Mr Feky, who will attend the match in Al Ain, hope that the game is a precursor to watching their team play at home again. Mr El Erian, who will see his team play in an international fixture next month, has more modest hopes for the Supercup.
“We’re looking forward to a good match and in good faith, to have a good relationship between the fans and players.”

What people say about us
Just a note to thank you for the delicious recipe for Bhaji Frittata that appeared in the last edition of Village Emporium. Cooked it for Supper earlier in the week, and it was a huge hit. Not only that, but it’s wonderful cold too, with a salad. Am just about to send it to friends in New Zealand – it’s that good !
Sue Sherman, Winwick.
Fraser James have been advertising in the village emporium for nearly 7 years now. Village emporium magazine is the only magazine we regularly advertise in and without a doubt I feel this is the best local business magazine there is. Being in the furniture industry, our advert images change with each issue, Village emporium always go above and beyond to make sure our adverts are exactly how we would like them and they are so easy to work with. We find the business we receive from featuring in the magazine incredible and I couldn’t recommend The Village emporium highly enough!
Peter O’Neill – CEO Fraser James Furniture
Just wanted to say how much I look forward to the Village Emporium popping through my letterbox every two months! First thing is to get the kettle on then settle down with a cuppa and your publication! Always plenty of interesting articles and it is my bible when I need help. I have successfully used it for a new bathroom and bedroom, help in the garden, choosing somewhere to eat out, recipes and generally finding out what’s on in the local area. It is so reassuring to be able to use local businesses who need to maintain a good local reputation. Long may you thrive!!
Bev – Hellidon
I just wanted to drop a quick message of appreciation for the Village Emporium magazine we receive. It’s a great roundup of what is happening in our district including community events and great features on different topics. Not many communities are lucky enough to receive something like this so I just wanted to say thank you – I look forward to reading each issue. Keep up the good work!
Emily Barton
I think it’s a really good thing to support local businesses. The Village Emporium is a perfect way to do this. It’s the first place I look if I need a local trade or service and the only local advertising material I actually keep. When a new issue arrives I always flick through it to see what’s happening in the local area too. It’s a treasure trove of useful tips and information. Colourful presentation makes you want to pick it up and read.I’d miss it if it didn’t drop through my door! If you want to support local businesses then I’d certainly recommend you tell your friends and family about the Village Emporium.
Wendy, Staverton
Thank you for my Village Emporium mags – a perfect local magazine packed full of the right sort of info. Congratulations Team VE.
Sue Ainley, Rugby

Warm clothing collection in Leamington for refugee children
These Hands Are Better Than None eT1M6oEhlfuPthGzKpgV

A Leamington company is holding a collection on Saturday to help keep refugee children warm in the winter.
People can bring items for children aged from newborn to 16 including jumpers, fleece jackets, baby suits, waterproof jackets, cagoules and trousers, thermal underwear including vests and long Johns, body warmers, new socks, winter boots, waterproof wellies, warm hats, sleeping bags and blankets to Comtec Translations Ltd at 62 Brandon Parade between 9am and 5.30pm.
Materials shold be polyester or wool but not cotton as it holds moisture close to the body and will make the youngsters cold.
Comtec is working with These Hands Are Better Than None to collect donations for refugee children in Greece, Turkey and the Balkans.
Sophie Howe, The company’s director, said; “It is heart breaking to see pictures on the news of scared refugee children - cold and wet - waiting in the mud to be let into/travel across Europe.
“We must act now and get warm, waterproof clothing out to these children as soon as possible.
These Hands Are Better Than None is a charity formed in September by four mothers who are based in Cannock, Walsall and Coventry.
Its aim is to support refugees in light of the crisis the world is currently facing.
Theyn have said: “We cannot imagine how people make the heartbreaking choice between staying at home and living each day in total fear or gathering together the family and walking for hundreds of miles, living under scrappy pieces of tarpaulin with minimum food and water and maybe embarking on dangerous journeys across choppy seas - all in the hope of a better future.
“We hope that we will never have to make that choice.
“We want to try our hardest to help the people that have had to make that choice and those that will in the future.”
Leamington-based removals company Cleavers has donated 40 boxes to ship the items of clothing.
There is some parking at the side of the building.
