Michael S. Meldman, 60, wasn’t a golfer when he foundedDiscovery Land Companyin 1994, a real estate business based in Scottsdale, Ariz., that has developed 25 private high-end golf communities in North America and the Caribbean.
“Master-planned communities and golf were hugely popular and the premium drivers in real estate,’’ he said, “and I saw an opportunity, even though I hadn’t ever really played golf. In fact, I only started playing seriously five years ago.”
Today, Mr. Meldman’s luxurious communities with members-only golf clubs — Baker’s Bay in the Bahamas, Yellowstone Club in Big Sky, Mont., and Silo Ridge in Amenia, N.Y., among them — range from 450 acres to 14,000 acres, or about 180 hectares to 5,700 hectares, and have homes that command prices from $3 million to $80 million.
The communities stand out for amenities that rival five-star destination resorts, with golf courses designed by Tom Fazio and Jack Nicklaus, restaurants with top-quality farm-to-table cuisine and an extensive range of wellness-themed activities. And let’s not forget the Casamigos Tequila bar at each resort. (Mr. Meldman founded the brand with the entrepreneur Rande Gerber and the actor George Clooney.)
Below are excerpts from a recent interview with Mr. Meldman.
Tell me about your vision for Discovery Land Company.
People were very interested in golf and master-planned communities, and my idea was to create a luxury concept that combined both. I wanted to find great pieces of land and build around the natural landscapes so that the communities looked like they belonged there, not like standard developments. They are all built to be sprawling with plenty of space between the homes and have lots of green space. And they all incorporate a lot of natural stone.
Although the communities are in different locations, what characteristics do they share?
They all have golf, of course. They’re all gated and have guards, clubhouses with great gyms and spas and fantastic restaurants. They’re also very family-friendly and casual. I think that a lot of golf clubs can be intimidating, but at ours, you can play barefoot in board shorts. And, we have two to three comfort stations on all the golf courses, which are basically mini-restaurants that serve everything from candy bars to foie gras to warm pretzels.
In each resort, we hire locals to teach residents about the outdoor activities in the area. At Iron Horse in Whitefish, Mont., for example, you can go fly fishing. At Makena, in Maui, you can go deep sea fishing, scuba diving and snorkeling. And in most of our oceanside locations, kids can release baby turtles into the ocean. My idea is that the people who live in my communities should embrace the areas that they’re in.
How do you choose your locations?
I seek out places where there is a good amount of land and where zoning allows us to build homes and a golf course. Also, there has to be enough to do in the area besides golf. In Silo Ridge, for example, in the Hudson Valley, which is the newest community, the horseback riding, hunting, mountain biking and hiking are all excellent.
If you had to give one piece of advice for someone looking to buy a home in a golf community what would it be?
Make sure that the developer has a track record of success and is going to commit to the vision of what they initially present.
What are the most important features to get right when designing golf community homes?
These days, I think they should have a more contemporary aesthetic as opposed to traditional, which was the norm when I started Discovery. They should have big windows that take advantage of the views, ideally of the golf course, and have spacious indoor and outdoor areas where families and friends can gather and spend time together like a nice-sized patio, a family room with comfortable, oversized couches and a dining room with a table that accommodates large groups. It’s also great to have an open-plan home where the kitchen and family room are one big room, since these are the two areas where everyone tends to spend the most time. And the homes shouldn’t be too close to each other so that everyone has enough privacy.
In your opinion, how have golf communities changed over the last decade?
They’ve gone from golf being the only consideration to being simply one of many drivers. There is now a greater emphasis on cuisine, the nongolf outdoor pursuits and activities, the family-friendliness and the safety concerns addressed by being in a gated community.
In a great golf community, there has to be something that’s appealing to each family member. We have a lot of people living in our communities who don’t golf. They’re attracted to the other things Discovery clubs offer.
Also, the demographic skews much younger. In the past, golf clubs attracted a lot of retirees, but now, there are a lot of people in their mid-30s to mid-40s enjoying them with their families that include young children.
Are golf community residents different than your usual homeowner?
I think that they’re inherently more social. They’re looking to connect with other people on a regular basis and love the idea of a sense of community. I’m not saying other homeowners are antisocial, but they may not care as much about the social offerings and accessibility to the lineup of activities.

AUGUSTA, GA — Tommy Fleetwood may already be one of golf's most recognizable players but the mop-topped Englishman is determined to be marked out as winner rather than for a great head of hair.
Looking more like a member of Hall of Fame rock band Fleetwood Mac than the PGA Tour, the 28-year-old, with his scruffy beard and long locks spilling out from under a baseball cap, was easily distinguishable from the cookie cutter golfing crowd getting in some practice on Monday at Augusta National ahead of the Masters.
Considering Fleetwood's PGA Tour resume does not yet include a title, he would not have drawn much attention had it not been for his "better to burn out than fade away" approach to tournament play which has amplified his rocker image.
That "all in" attitude was on full display during the final round of the Players Championship last month when he was trailing Rory McIlroy by two strokes with two holes to play. Fleetwood attacked the pin on the infamous 17th island green and paid the price as his title hopes ended in a watery grave.
"I don't know why people would expect me to play for the middle of the green if I had a chance of catching Rory," Fleetwood told reporters. "Maybe that's my difference than some other people, I'm always going to play to win.
"Not that golf will ever define me as a person but I'm never going to look back on my career and say, oh, I finished third at the Players, that was a good week. Or, oh, I finished top five at the Masters, I made a couple of nice pars on the last to finish top five.
"That's probably something I'll never say to my kids or grandkids. That's not something to be that proud of.
"Winning is what it's all about."
While Fleetwood is still chasing a maiden PGA Tour title, he does know his way to the winner's circle with four victories on the European Tour.
He has regularly featured on the leaderboard at majors, including a runner-up finish at last year's U.S. Open and has shown good form this season with three top 10s.
More importantly Fleetwood believes his Masters apprenticeship has reached the point where he can fight for a green jacket.
After missing the cut in his first visit to Augusta in 2017, Fleetwood improved to a 17th place finish last year. He showed signs that he was getting comfortable with the layout after carding a six-under 66 in the third round.
"Year one, it's all so new," said Fleetwood. "Year two, you've been here already, so you're more comfortable with it and it just kind of progresses.
"There's a different atmosphere.
"It's the first major of the year and ... everything that's happened before just doesn't really matter.
"You know, this is it."

PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. — The celebration was muted, even if Pebble Beach Golf Links was at its most radiant on Monday morning, with clear skies and bright sunshine casting the Pacific Ocean, the 18th hole and Phil Mickelson in an exquisite light. Mickelson turned to Paul Casey, the player he had vanquished to win his fifth Pebble Beach Pro-Am title after a lengthy weather delay, to thank him for helping produce the sublime stagecraft.
With Casey carrying a three-stroke lead into the final round, Mickelson was forced to bear down over the final 18, and he produced a seven-under 65 in the final round. Mickelson’s 72-hole total was 19-under 268, three strokes better than Casey, a friend and fellow Arizona State alumnus.
So focused was Mickelson during the last round that he tried to persuade Casey and tournament officials to finish the final two holes amid fading light Sunday evening.
Casey, who ended up winning the team event with his amateur partner, Don Colleran, declined to play on, and after they both finished with a par and birdie on the final holes in front of a robust crowd of early risers the next morning, Mickelson gave credit where it was due.
“Paul made the tough call, but it was the right decision,” Mickelson said, adding, “Sometimes I just get in my own little bubble and I don’t see the big picture.”
Mickelson’s decision-making in the caldron of competition can sometimes be a liability, as was evident in his collapse on the final hole of the 2006 U.S. Open at Winged Foot — or more recently, in his decision to one-timea moving puttduring the third round of last year’s U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills.
But in closing out his 44th PGA Tour victory this week, Mickelson, 48, was a study in restraint. After his birdie putt at the 18th hole dropped, he picked the ball out of the hole as though he were retrieving a package from his front stoop. It was Mickelson’s second victory in nearly a year — he won the World Golf Championships event in Mexico City last March — and his first on U.S. soil in 2,199 days, since he captured the 2013 Waste Management Phoenix Open.
Any victory is special at Pebble Beach, a historic venue with personal resonance for Mickelson and his family, but he hopes a more meaningful celebration on the 18th green awaits him in June, for the 119th U.S. Open — the only major tournament that Mickelson has not won.
Can he strike gold twice at Pebble Beach in the same year? Two men have proved it’s possible; Jack Nicklaus in 1972, on his way to a seven-victory season, and Tiger Woods in 2000, when he won nine PGA Tour events. Nicklaus was in his 30s in 1972 and Woods in his 20s in 2000, both at the peak of their powers.
Mickelson will turn 49 on the final day of this year’s U.S. Open, and a win would make him the oldest men’s major champion, surpassing Julius Boros, who was 48 when he won the 1968 P.G.A. Championship. Mickelson’s younger brother and caddie, Tim, suggested people discount Mickelson’s chances at their peril.
“He’s won twice now in the last 11 months,” Tim Mickelson said, adding, “Obviously it shows he can win still.”
Mickelson’s game appears to be aging as well as did the bottle of 1990 Romanée-Conti wine that he drank from the Claret Jug after winning the 2013 British Open. He has a second and a first in his last three starts — with a missed cut at the Phoenix Open sandwiched in between. The resurgence of Mickelson and the 43-year-old Woods has made the men’s game infinitely more compelling.
“I believe that if I play my best, if Tiger plays his best, it’s good enough to win on any week,” Mickelson said, adding, “I just think that both myself and Tiger are going to have a really, really good year.”
Mickelson and Woods both have found their way to the winner’s circle more recently than either Jordan Spieth or Rory McIlroy have. Like Mickelson, Spieth and McIlroy are each one major title from completing a career Grand Slam. McIlroy, 29, will get his opportunity first, at the Masters in April. Spieth’s turn will come next, at the P.G.A. Championship in May.
And then the spotlight will settle like a laser beam on Mickelson, who played his first major as a pro at the 1992 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach. He noted that this year marked the 100th anniversary of his maternal grandfather’s debut as a pre-teen caddie at Pebble Beach, where he made 25 cents a round.
During the greenside trophy presentation, Mickelson told the story of how his grandfather, Al Santos, who grew up in Monterey, Calif., dropped out of school in the fourth grade to help support his family and shortly thereafter found his way to the Pebble Beach caddie shack.
Mickelson said his grandfather carried a 1900 silver dollar in his pocket while he worked, and passed it down to Mickelson, who uses it as a ball marker whenever he plays here. Mickelson describes the place as special now, but after he missed the cut at the 1992 U.S. Open, he skipped the Tour stop here in 1993 and 1994.
“I don’t know I had a good big picture of the overall importance of the tournament to the game and what it provides and how much I love the place,” Mickelson explained in 2012.
Playing Pebble Beach has taught Mickelson to take nothing for granted. He was trailing by two strokes after 36 holes in 1996 but never got a chance to make a charge as inclement weather washed out the final two rounds. Two years later, Mickelson successfully outlasted Mother Nature and the field for his first Pebble Beach Pro-Am title.
In 1998, the tournament’s first two rounds were played in stormy weather in February, which rendered the course soft and the greens slow, and the final round took place under bright sunshine in August, and the course was fast and firm — as it should be in June for the U.S. Open. In winning his first pro-am title, Mickelson might have acquired the blueprint for realizing his last major goal in golf.
“I have such great memories here,” Mickelson said. “I would love to add to it.”
But Mickelson added that he wouldn’t allow himself to look any further ahead than the Masters. He has spent so long fixated on winning the U.S. Open, but this week taught him the beauty that can reward those who see the big picture.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Jordan Spieth visited the Augusta National media interview room almost unnoticed for his assigned rendezvous with the press on Tuesday, like a guest invited to make up the numbers.
Only a handful of journalists bothered turning up to hear what the 2015 Masters champion had to say, a far cry from the not-so-long ago days when he packed out the house, seemingly destined to become an all-time great.
Though Spieth is only 25, and time is still on his side, his star has waned considerably since he captured the 2017 British Open, his third major title, leaving him only a PGA Championship short of the career grand slam of all four modern majors.
He became the second player after Jack Nicklaus to complete three legs of the slam before the age of 24, rarefied company to be sure.
Spieth almost pulled off a comeback for the ages in the final round last year, storming from nine strokes behind Patrick Reed to finish third with a closing 64.
But Spieth has regressed since then, so much so that a tie for 30th at the Texas Open on Sunday was his best stroke play result all year.
But he struck an upbeat note on Tuesday as he assessed his chances this week.
"My expectations are high," he said.
"I feel great about the state of my game right now. I feel like my recent results aren't a tell of where my game is actually at, and I feel I've made a lot of strides in the last couple of days in the tee-to-green game.
"Really just off the tee, my long game has been the only separation from being able to win golf tournaments over the last month or so."
Not everyone is convinced.
"His golf swing has changed so much, it's almost been completely stripped of all its athleticism," Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee said of Spieth in a conference call last week.
"His swing has completely changed, and it looks to me like he's in a very tough spot, and who knows if he'll ever find his way back.
"A lot of people who go down that road can't remember how to get back home."
That might sound a little bit negative but there are no more guarantees in golf than in any other walk of life.
Spieth of course was much more optimistic.
"I feel really good about my game, where it's at, heading into this week," he said.
"It's just a matter of trust in the stuff that I'm working on... I don't feel like there's any added pressure this week.
"I feel kind of under the radar, which is really nice. That changes day-to-day out here though."

The Australia Letteris a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau chief.Sign upto get it by email.
This week, we have a special treat:Karen Crouse, one of our sportswriters who was here for the Australian Open, spent time with Briony Lyle, the wife of Jarrod Lyle, one of Australia’s most beloved golfers, who died of cancer a few months ago.
He was only 36. Here’s hisNew York Times obituaryif you missed it.
We’ve turned the newsletter over to Karen and Briony, for insights on sport and life. Tell us what you think atnytaustralia@nytimes.com.
___
Briony Lyle laughs when she thinks about it now, but in the days after her husband, Jarrod, died following a lengthy battle with leukemia, she wondered what she would do with herself. For nearly a decade, her days had revolved around Jarrod’s schedule, first as a professional golfer and, later as a second-and-third-time cancer patient.
Jarrod’s death last August at age 36 unleasheda global outpouring of emotion and supportfrom people whose lives he touched or who were touched by the story of a seemingly regular bloke who had absorbed life’s — and golf’s — bad breaks with grit and good cheer.
At the time I marveled at how a group of athletes who tend to measure success so rigidly, who generally buy into the belief that they are what their scores say they are, rallied to give a farewell befitting a giant to Jarrod, a journeyman whose highest finish in 121 P.G.A. Tour starts was a tie for fourth.
Curious to know what life was like for Briony after the elegies stopped, I followed the Australia Day migration of beachgoers to Torquay, the gateway to the Great Ocean Road, where Briony and Jarrod moved in 2012 and where, she said, Jarrod peacefully passed his final days.
The half-year anniversary of Jarrod’s death was upon her, but that’s not why Briony saw reminders of her husband everywhere.
The day before, an American, Bryson DeChambeau, had claimed a seven-stroke victory at the Dubai Desert Classic, a European Tour event. Briony has never met the 25-year-old DeChambeau, but at the P.G.A. Championship, held the week after Jarrod’s death, DeChambeau won a long-driving contest and donated the $25,000 winner’s check to an education fund set up for the Lyles’s young daughters, Lusi, 6, and Jemma, 2.
Since then, Briony, who never really cared for golf, has been a huge fan of DeChambeau. She recently sent him a thank-you note, which began the same as hundreds of others that she had written over the past few months: “We may never meet, but what you did was so amazing, just to say thank you is not enough.”
This week in the United States, the P.G.A. Tour is outside Phoenix, for a tournament known for its party atmosphere, huge crowds and stadium-style 16th hole.
The par 3 has been the scene of nine aces, including one by Tiger Woods and another by Jarrod in what was perhaps the signature moment of his P.G.A. Tour career.
It happened during the second round of the 2011 event, and Jarrod’s reaction was almost as memorable as a result. While the shot was airborne, he made the motion to sit with both hands as if his golf ball were a puppy at obedience school. After the ball bounced on the green and rolled in the cup, he pumped his arms multiple times, then windmilled his arms to churn the already raucous crowd of more than 25,000 into even more of a lather.
Smiling ear to ear, he ran over to his caddie shouting, “You beauty,” only, in typical Jarrod fashion, with an expletive added for emphasis.
Briony said Jarrod replayed the video of the shot and his reaction hundreds of times over the years.
“He’d tell people not to believe all the views it has gotten because he’s been responsible for most of them,” she said. “People thought he was just being humble, but he was telling the truth.”
She laughed.
“He watched that video all the time. I can remember waking up to him giggling and I’d ask him what he was laughing at and he’d say, ‘I just watched the hole-in-one again.’”
Golf did not captivate Briony, who was a high school classmate of Jarrod’s in their hometown, Shepparton, in northern Victoria. When they started dating a few years later, she attended his tournaments but recognized early on that she was going to need a diversion.
“I couldn’t possibly spend my time walking aimlessly around golf courses pretending I was invested in every shot and every moment,” said Briony, who enrolled in classes in Melbourne to become a massage therapist. She accumulated her required training hours, she said, by setting up a massage table at tournaments and kneading the muscles of the caddies.
She earned her certification in 2012, shortly before giving birth to the couple’s first daughter, Lusi. Another daughter, Jemma, arrived four years later. Around the time of Lusi’s birth, Jarrod learned that the leukemia he had battled successfully in high school had returned.
He was off the P.G.A. Tour for more than two years,then came back and made 20 more starts. He had returned to Australia to play his home tour and try his hand at broadcasting when he found out in late 2017 that the leukemia had returned a third time.
During his initial battle with the disease, Jarrod became acquainted with Challenge, a nonprofit dedicated to providing practical and personalized services to the families of cancer patients. The organization’s mascot isa duck named Leuk, and since Jarrod’s death people from all over the world have snatched up Leuk merchandise, everything from duck head covers to pins and ball markers.
Next week top performers from the P.G.A. Tour of Australasia, the Australian Ladies Professional Golf, the European Tour and the Ladies European Tour will converge on Barwon Heads Golf Club, not far from Torquay, for the Vic Open. Briony will be there, selling Leuk the Duck merchandise to raise money for families dealing with cancer.
“I have my moments — many, many moments — mostly nighttime where I can’t sleep because of things playing over in my mind,” Briony said. “But I’m able to grab on to this incredible thing that came out of what happened, there’s so much good that came out of it and I’m just so determined to draw attention to this cause because I’m not unique, unfortunately.”
A bittersweet thing happened; she lost her golfer husband and found a calling that drew her deeper into golf.
“After he died, I kept telling people over and over, my life tended to revolve around Jarrod either in illness or career and now my life continues to revolve around him,” she said. “That’s the legacy.”

An undocumented immigrant who worked at one of President Trump’s golf clubs in New Jersey for years and recently spoke out about her experience will attend his State of the Union address after being invited by her Democratic congresswoman, the woman’s lawyer and the congresswoman’s office said Wednesday.
The undocumented immigrant, Victorina Morales, had worked as a housekeeper at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., since 2013, and spoke to The New York Times aspart of an article published last month. The report revealed that the president’s company — the Trump Organization — was, for years, employing people at the golf club who are in the country illegally.
In a brief interview on Wednesday, Ms. Morales said that on the advice of her lawyer, she stopped going to work on Dec. 4, two days before the Times article was published. Still, the lawyer, Anibal Romero, said that neither he nor his client had received notice that she had been fired. He said Ms. Morales’s employment status with the golf club was not entirely clear.
Since leaving her job, Ms. Morales, who is from Guatemala, has campaigned for rights and fair treatment for undocumented immigrants. On Wednesday, she said she was pleased to have been invited tothe State of the Union, that she has accepted the invitation and that she was “very proud because I am going to raise my voice for all of us immigrants.”
“I’m not scared to show my face,” she said, speaking in Spanish. “I am not speaking for me, I’m speaking on behalf of millions of undocumented immigrants who live in the United States.”
The congresswoman, Bonnie Watson Coleman, represents the New Jersey district in which Ms. Morales lives. The news that Ms. Morales had been invited to attend Tuesday’s State of the Union address as Ms. Watson Coleman’s guest was reported byThe Washington Poston Wednesday.
“Immigrants by and large are hardworking, trustworthy and skilled people who simply want to work and build better lives here,” Ms. Watson Coleman said in a statement. “For years these kinds of people were loyal and dedicated enough to be Trump Organization employees. I hope that in his State of the Union address, Donald Trump will finally acknowledge the real face of immigrants in this country — women and children fleeing violence; law-abiding, taxpaying people who would do almost anything to be Americans. And if he can’t, I’ve invited Victorina so that he may look her in her eyes to tell his lies to a familiar face.”
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday evening.
Mr. Trump has made border security and protecting jobs for Americans cornerstones of his presidency, and his insistence on building a border wall led to the recent partial government shutdown. He has labeled illegal immigration “a major, major problem,” and pledged to build a border wall while his administration has carried out workplace raids and payroll audits.
The Times article, published Dec. 6, said undocumented immigrants had been employed for years at the Trump National Golf Club as housekeepers, landscapers and kitchen staff. It also said they were kept on the payroll even though management was aware they had used phony documents to secure employment, as is common among undocumented immigrants.
Ms. Morales previously told The Times that a manager at Bedminster had helped her secure a new fake Social Security number and legal permanent-residency card after telling her that those on file had expired.
Since the article was published, about a dozen workers deemed ineligible to work in the United States because they lacked legal immigration status have been terminated at the Bedminster club, according to people familiar with the matter.
Another dozen were fired at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County, N.Y.,this month, a development first reportedby The Washington Post.
The Trump Organization also said late Tuesday that it wasputting in place a system to weed out undocumented immigrants who try to get jobsat its properties.
“I must say, for me personally, this whole thing is truly heartbreaking,” Eric Trump, an executive vice president with the Trump Organization, said in the statement on Tuesday. “Our employees are like family, but when presented with fake documents, an employer has little choice.”
He said that hiring undocumented immigrants was not a problem unique to the Trump Organization, and that it “demonstrates that our immigration system is severely broken and needs to be fixed immediately.”

(Reuters) - Dutchman Daan Huizing made nine birdies to take the lead in the first round of the Jordan Mixed Open, the first professional tournament with men and women competing against each other for the same prize, on Thursday.
Huizing shot an eight-under 64 in Aqaba to lead England's Meghan MacLaren, a Ladies European Tour winner, and her compatriot Jack Senior by one stroke.
Forty professionals and one amateur player each from the Challenge Tour, the over-50s Tour and the Ladies European Tour are in the field, competing for a prize fund of around $400,000.
"Today was pretty complete and I was shaping the ball nicely, both ways, which is something I've worked on very hard over the winter," Huizing told reporters.
"I made some good putts and mentally I was in good shape as well, sticking to my process, so there are a lot of good signs and I'm looking forward to tomorrow."
MacLaren, who sparked debate in January over the disparity in pay between men's and women's events, was happy to finish among the leaders after setting the early clubhouse target.
"If I'm going to write about it and talk about it all the time, then I better back it up with my golf," MacLaren, the only woman to finish in the top 10, said. "If I'm up there it means the girls can take advantage.
"I'm delighted to do it at this tournament because hopefully it will send a message. But any time you shoot seven under in any tournament you're not going to be too far off the lead."
The course was designed by Australian Greg Norman who was world number one for over 300 weeks in the 1980s and 1990s.
"To construct a format in which women and men compete together over the same course is an impressive feat," Norman said in a statement.
"There is no doubt that events that showcase golfing talent regardless of gender, such as the Jordan Mixed Open... are the future of the game."
The Challenge Tour players are playing from tees making up a 7,152-yard course, the seniors cover 6,601 yards and the women 6,139 yards.
"Our first and primary priority was to engineer a format that could showcase golfing talent regardless of gender," director of operations Chris White said.
"This not only means taking into consideration carry yardages, both off the tee and throughout the player's whole bag, but also the positioning of bunkers and hazards."
Although the Jordan tournament is the first, official mixed gender tournament, men and women have competed against each other previously, most notably at the Wendy's 3-Tour Challenge, a single-day event which ran from 1992-2013.

Letter 92
ByDamien Cave
The Australia Letteris a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau chief.Sign upto get it by email.
This week, we have a special treat:Karen Crouse, one of our sportswriters who was here for the Australian Open, spent time with Briony Lyle, the wife of Jarrod Lyle, one of Australia’s most beloved golfers, who died of cancer a few months ago.
He was only 36. Here’s hisNew York Times obituaryif you missed it.
We’ve turned the newsletter over to Karen and Briony, for insights on sport and life. Tell us what you think atnytaustralia@nytimes.com.
___
Briony Lyle laughs when she thinks about it now, but in the days after her husband, Jarrod, died following a lengthy battle with leukemia, she wondered what she would do with herself. For nearly a decade, her days had revolved around Jarrod’s schedule, first as a professional golfer and, later as a second-and-third-time cancer patient.
Jarrod’s death last August at age 36 unleasheda global outpouring of emotion and supportfrom people whose lives he touched or who were touched by the story of a seemingly regular bloke who had absorbed life’s — and golf’s — bad breaks with grit and good cheer.
At the time I marveled at how a group of athletes who tend to measure success so rigidly, who generally buy into the belief that they are what their scores say they are, rallied to give a farewell befitting a giant to Jarrod, a journeyman whose highest finish in 121 P.G.A. Tour starts was a tie for fourth.
Curious to know what life was like for Briony after the elegies stopped, I followed the Australia Day migration of beachgoers to Torquay, the gateway to the Great Ocean Road, where Briony and Jarrod moved in 2012 and where, she said, Jarrod peacefully passed his final days.
The half-year anniversary of Jarrod’s death was upon her, but that’s not why Briony saw reminders of her husband everywhere.
The day before, an American, Bryson DeChambeau, had claimed a seven-stroke victory at the Dubai Desert Classic, a European Tour event. Briony has never met the 25-year-old DeChambeau, but at the P.G.A. Championship, held the week after Jarrod’s death, DeChambeau won a long-driving contest and donated the $25,000 winner’s check to an education fund set up for the Lyles’s young daughters, Lusi, 6, and Jemma, 2.
Since then, Briony, who never really cared for golf, has been a huge fan of DeChambeau. She recently sent him a thank-you note, which began the same as hundreds of others that she had written over the past few months: “We may never meet, but what you did was so amazing, just to say thank you is not enough.”
This week in the United States, the P.G.A. Tour is outside Phoenix, for a tournament known for its party atmosphere, huge crowds and stadium-style 16th hole.
The par 3 has been the scene of nine aces, including one by Tiger Woods and another by Jarrod in what was perhaps the signature moment of his P.G.A. Tour career.
It happened during the second round of the 2011 event, and Jarrod’s reaction was almost as memorable as a result. While the shot was airborne, he made the motion to sit with both hands as if his golf ball were a puppy at obedience school. After the ball bounced on the green and rolled in the cup, he pumped his arms multiple times, then windmilled his arms to churn the already raucous crowd of more than 25,000 into even more of a lather.
Smiling ear to ear, he ran over to his caddie shouting, “You beauty,” only, in typical Jarrod fashion, with an expletive added for emphasis.
Briony said Jarrod replayed the video of the shot and his reaction hundreds of times over the years.
“He’d tell people not to believe all the views it has gotten because he’s been responsible for most of them,” she said. “People thought he was just being humble, but he was telling the truth.”
She laughed.
“He watched that video all the time. I can remember waking up to him giggling and I’d ask him what he was laughing at and he’d say, ‘I just watched the hole-in-one again.’”
Golf did not captivate Briony, who was a high school classmate of Jarrod’s in their hometown, Shepparton, in northern Victoria. When they started dating a few years later, she attended his tournaments but recognized early on that she was going to need a diversion.
“I couldn’t possibly spend my time walking aimlessly around golf courses pretending I was invested in every shot and every moment,” said Briony, who enrolled in classes in Melbourne to become a massage therapist. She accumulated her required training hours, she said, by setting up a massage table at tournaments and kneading the muscles of the caddies.
She earned her certification in 2012, shortly before giving birth to the couple’s first daughter, Lusi. Another daughter, Jemma, arrived four years later. Around the time of Lusi’s birth, Jarrod learned that the leukemia he had battled successfully in high school had returned.
He was off the P.G.A. Tour for more than two years,then came back and made 20 more starts. He had returned to Australia to play his home tour and try his hand at broadcasting when he found out in late 2017 that the leukemia had returned a third time.
During his initial battle with the disease, Jarrod became acquainted with Challenge, a nonprofit dedicated to providing practical and personalized services to the families of cancer patients. The organization’s mascot isa duck named Leuk, and since Jarrod’s death people from all over the world have snatched up Leuk merchandise, everything from duck head covers to pins and ball markers.
Next week top performers from the P.G.A. Tour of Australasia, the Australian Ladies Professional Golf, the European Tour and the Ladies European Tour will converge on Barwon Heads Golf Club, not far from Torquay, for the Vic Open. Briony will be there, selling Leuk the Duck merchandise to raise money for families dealing with cancer.
“I have my moments — many, many moments — mostly nighttime where I can’t sleep because of things playing over in my mind,” Briony said. “But I’m able to grab on to this incredible thing that came out of what happened, there’s so much good that came out of it and I’m just so determined to draw attention to this cause because I’m not unique, unfortunately.”
A bittersweet thing happened; she lost her golfer husband and found a calling that drew her deeper into golf.
“After he died, I kept telling people over and over, my life tended to revolve around Jarrod either in illness or career and now my life continues to revolve around him,” she said. “That’s the legacy.”

AUGUSTA Ga. (Reuters) - Rory McIlroy's desire to complete his collection of golf's four majors with a win at this week's Masters has led the Northern Irishman to try a fresh approach, one that focuses on meditation and juggling.
McIlroy enters the year's first major as the hottest player on the planet and he credits his solid start to 2019 with a new attitude that is all about perspective, persistence and poise, or what he refers to as the three P's.
The new formula for McIlroy, who will play the opening two rounds this week with American Rickie Fowler and Australia's Cameron Smith, centres around meditation, juggling and mind training.
"Look, I'm not going to go and live with the monks for a couple months in Nepal, but just to be able to get your mind in the right place and be able to focus and to centre yourself," McIlroy told a news conference at Augusta National on Tuesday.
"It's 10 minutes a day. It's not as if I'm being consumed by it. But definitely something that has helped from time to time. Especially in situations where you need your mind to be right."
McIlroy has five consecutive top-10 finishes at the Masters yet his defining moment at Augusta National remains his final-round collapse in 2011 when he failed to close out the win despite entering the day with a four-shot lead.
But McIlroy, who has since gone on to win four times at golf's three other majors, has visions of becoming just the sixth person to complete the career grand slam and hopes his new approach will prove fruitful.
The 29-year-old Northern Irishman has a top-six finish in each of the six stroke play events he has played this year, including a triumph at the Players Championship where he meditated for 20 minutes ahead of the final round.
Early indications, therefore, are that McIlroy may be on the right path with his meditation and juggling.
"It's helped me play some of the best golf of my career so far this year, and you know, hopefully that will continue."
When it comes to juggling, McIlroy described himself as a "rookie" who can only handle three balls at once.
"You know, maybe what resonates with me is isn't going to resonate with someone else, but I found what I feel is the best path forward for me and I've committed to it," McIlroy said.
McIlroy, who had another close call last year when he began the final round three shots behind eventual winner Patrick Reed, said the pressure he puts on himself at Augusta National compared to his previous appearances has changed.
"I would dearly love to win this tournament one day. If it doesn't happen this week, that's totally fine, I'll come back next year and have another crack at it," said McIlroy.
"But I'm happy with where everything is, body, mind, game."

AUGUSTA Ga. (Reuters) - Rickie Fowler returned to Augusta National on Monday with the heartbreak of last year's runner-up Masters finish firmly behind him and brimming with confidence that a breakthrough major win is closer than ever.
Fowler, a five-times winner on the PGA Tour, has three runner-up finishes to show from 36 major appearances and as a result finds his name on the list of the best players who have never won one of golf's four blue riband events.
But such talk does not discourage the 30-year-old American, who comes into the year's first major in solid form and among the favorites to claim a Green Jacket.
"Compared to four, five, whatever years ago, yeah, I'm more ready than I've ever been," Fowler told reporters. "Not saying that I can sit up here and tell you I'm definitely going to go win, but I like my chances.
"I love this place. I know I can play well around here. For me, every time I get to play it, it's fun ... I get to use my imagination around here."
Last year Fowler started the final round at Augusta National five shots behind overnight leader Patrick Reed but a sparkling back nine, which included a birdie at the last, saw him card a five-under-par 67.
The strong finish was not enough as Reed managed to hang on for a one-stroke victory but Fowler, after getting over the pain of another near miss, was able to take plenty of positives from his performance.
"The way I executed on the back nine Sunday last year was definitely something I pull from, and it was a lot of fun to be in the mix, birdieing 18, to make Patrick earn it a bit," said Fowler.
"But I was just a little bit too far back, and Patrick put together a strong week of golf.
"So it was fun. It was great to be in the mix, and like I said, have a chance. But time to do one better."
Fowler's performance at last year's Masters also marked the first time in eight starts at Augusta National that he recorded four par or better rounds.
He has made a strong start to 2019, including a win at the Phoenix Open in February, and is fresh off a share of 17th place at the Valero Texas Open where Fowler said he ticked a lot of boxes when it came to having his golf game where he wanted it.
"Some guys don't like to play (the week) before a major. Sometimes they like to get work in at home with their coach or work on the game and spend time on the driving range," said Fowler.
"For me, playing and just seeing where the state of my game's at and what I may need to work at makes Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday a lot more efficient. I know exactly what I want to do."

RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. — Ally McDonald started the weekend as the highest L.P.G.A. nonwinner on the ANA Inspiration leaderboard. Could she become the second consecutive player, after Pernille Lindberg, to make the year’s first major her first L.P.G.A. victory?
Back in Mississippi, her home state, the players who competed against McDonald in high school know better than to discount her chances. After she took the first-round lead, two men posted recollections on the L.P.G.A.’s Facebook page of being outclassed by McDonald, who won the boys’ state championship in her senior year at Itawamba Agricultural High School.
McDonald, 26, competed on the boys’ team because there wasn’t enough interest to field a girls’ squad. “Once I got to probably my freshman, sophomore year, the state changed regulations and I had to move back to the boys’ tees,” McDonald said on Friday, adding, “They said if I was going to play with the boys, then you’re going to have to play where the boys play from.”
McDonald, who carded a two-over 74 on Saturday and is six strokes behind the leader, Jin Young Ko, recalled winning the state title on a course that was longer than Mission Hills Country Club’s 6,834-yard layout, and in their Facebook posts, Peyton Dunlap and Chandler Thompson remembered her “whipping up” on them. There were a few exceptions, said McDonald, who went on to star at Mississippi State, “but as a whole, the guys that I was surrounded by always respected me.”
On the L.P.G.A. Tour, the women are playing for more than money, trophies and world-ranking points. “What we’re working toward is having the same amount of respect that the men get,” said Jessica Korda, the women’s world No. 11.
Korda, who is in a group tied for eighth with, among others, McDonald after a third-round 71, is the women’s leader in the inaugural Aon Risk Reward Challenge, a competition on the PGA and L.P.G.A. Tours featuring a running tally of players’ scores on designated holes. At the end of the season, the players on each tour with the lowest scores in relation to par will receive $1 million bonuses.
“It’s a great step in the right direction,” Korda said, referring to the equal prize money.
The Tuesday before the first round of the ANA Inspiration was Equal Pay Day, the point in 2019 that women had to work until to earn what men made in 2018. In golf, the gender pay disparity is glaring.
When Georgia Hall won the Women’s British Open at Royal Lytham last August, she earned $490,000. A month earlier, Francesco Molinari collected $1.89 million for his victory at the men’s British Open at Carnoustie.
“It’s not only golf, clearly, it’s society, and we need to aim for having the same opportunities and the same prize fund in this eventually,” Molinari said last month.
Molinari has spent time around Hall at events for AON, a global professional services firm that uses both as brand ambassadors. Like McDonald’s male high school teammates, Molinari has more respect for Hall after getting to know her.
“The main thing is when you meet women like that, you see in the end we do the same thing, we have the same drive, the same passion, the same dreams,” he said. “Everything is exactly the same.”
The onus is not on the women to narrow the gap, he added, but on their male peers and on those who control the corporate coffers.
“What we can do as players is support the ladies’ tour,” Molinari said. “But I think the main thing is the exposure they get. It’s nowhere near where it should be, and that creates less interest in sponsors, less money.”
Molinari’s words rang as true as bird song Saturday as the best women in the world took a back seat to the top up-and-coming women, whose final round of the Augusta National Women’s Amateur, played on the same course that will host next week’s Masters, was shown on NBC. The three hours of network coverage bestowed upon the likes of the winner, the women’s world No. 1 amateur, Jennifer Kupcho, and the runner-up, Maria Fassi of Mexico, was three hours more than was conferred on McDonald, Korda, Hall and Company at the ANA Inspiration.
To Molinari’s point, neither Bank of America nor AT&T, two of the corporate sponsors whose girl-power-themed ads were in heavy rotation during Saturday’s Augusta women’s amateur final-round coverage, sponsors an L.P.G.A. event.
“I think all we can do is try to play the best golf we can and show the public and the sponsors and the media what we can do,” Hall said.
On this great week for women’s golf, is it progress that the Augusta National Women’s Amateur runner-up had a bigger stage and audience than the reigning Women’s British Open winner?
On the eve of the ANA Inspiration, which started on Thursday, the L.P.G.A. commissioner, Mike Whan, told reporters: “In my mind, the Augusta Women’s Amateur is an evolution, not a revolution. But maybe in time, it will be the revolution that I want it to be.”

AUGUSTA, Ga. — The first time Francesco Molinari arrived at The Masters, he was in white overalls. This year, the British Open champion is hoping to walk away in a green jacket.
A caddie for his brother Edoardo in 2006, Molinari "carried the clubs and prayed that (Edoardo) was going to hit good shots," the Italian told reporters on Tuesday.
"We were very inexperienced at this level and just trying to make the most of those two days."
This year, the 36-year-old will hit the links as the Open Championship's victor and a legitimate threat to take The Masters' top prize.
"I've had a lot of success in the last few months, and I think that the important thing is that I don't have to let my guard down," Molinari said.
"I still have to go through all the work and the process that got me to this point, and hopefully will get me even further forward in my career."
The world number seven has enjoyed a hot streak since becoming the first Italian professional golfer to win a major at the British Open in July, clinching the Ryder cup for Europe in September and winning the race to Dubai in November.
Most recently, the European Tour Golfer of the Year put on a putting master class to win March's Arnold Palmer Invitational.
"It's taken awhile, but obviously now success is coming quite often, and that's a nice feeling," Molinari said. "So I'll try to keep working to keep the success coming."
To do so this week he'll need to contend with Augusta National's famously challenging course, where his career best saw him tie for 19th in 2012.
Alongside his competitors, he'll also grapple with a new fifth hole on the course.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Like many golf fans, one of Brooks Koepka's most vivid Masters moments involves three-times champion Phil Mickelson.
Pulling it up from deep inside his childhood memory banks, Koepka recalled in detail on Tuesday his meeting with Mickelson near the Augusta National parking lot two decades ago when a starry eyed kid with dreams of being a Masters winner one day cornered 'Lefty' for an autograph.
"He turned me down, (I am) probably about the only kid Phil's ever turned down," recalled Koepka with a chuckle. "He told me years later, I shouldn't have been in the parking lot so fair enough.
"He doesn't remember. I mean, I can't believe he doesn't remember the first time he ever said no to a kid, signing an autograph.
"I told him, I think in 2014, I think we were playing a practice round at the British Open. I had to tell him. I was like, 'Listen, man, you stiffed me and I really didn't like you for a long time'.
"We can laugh about it now."
Fast forward 20 years and Koepka is a three-times major winner signing autographs at Augusta National -- the only hint of a scar left from the Mickelson brush-off is his difficulty in saying 'no' to a little kid.
Koepka said he has since got Mickelson's autograph and this week will be focused on getting his own name on the Masters trophy and slipping into a Green Jacket.
In each of his three previous Masters, the 28-year-old American has made progress but is still without a top-10, with his best finish a tie for 11th in 2017.
He watched last year's tournament from his couch recovering from a wrist injury.
He returns to Augusta National as a far different player, having since won three majors, back-to-back U.S. Opens in 2017 and 2018 along with the 2018 PGA Championship.
"I've got three trophies that I haven't had any time I've teed it up (here)," said Koepka. "I've never been a major champion when I played here.
"Completely different player probably. (I) Understand how to handle pressure a lot better, understand this golf course a lot better. Even sitting out a year, there are certain things you can pick up on when you're watching.
"And (I have) really kind of matured on and off the golf course. I think it is a big deal."
"It's nice to be back here. It's always a special place to be playing."

AUGUSTA, Georgia — A lot of fathers found themselves out of jobs on Friday as golfers playing in the Augusta National Women's Amateur (ANWA) opted for club caddies over daddies for the final round.
After the opening two rounds of the 54-hole tournament staged at Champions Retreat in nearby Evans, awed young women, many with their equally-awed fathers on their bags, got first look at the revered layout that is home for the Masters, the year's first major.
But walking with their daughters in Friday's practice round is as close as some dad caddies will come to Augusta National with several deciding on a switch and handing their fathers pink slips.
While dads may know their daughters better than anyone, local caddies, some who have worked Augusta National for decades, know the course and particularly the baffling greens.
For some, including Jennifer Kupcho, who will take a one- shot lead over Mexico’s Maria Fassi into the final round, that kind of knowledge trumps family ties.
The world's top-ranked amateur, Kupcho's decision to go with a local caddie was an easy one, although the American laughed she had not yet broken the news to her father Michael.
"I had my caddie there with me the first time I played so we had fun and he knows what he is doing," said Kupcho, who used the same caddie Brian Murphy when she played Augusta as a guest. "I think he's hired."
HISTORIC DAY
Instead of being part of an historic day on which the first competitive women's round will be played at Augusta National and a champion crowned, Michael Kupcho will watch from outside the ropes along with Kevin Harford, who was on his daughter Haylee's bag the first two rounds.
A tough choice, however, was made easier when Harford told his daughter the smart move might be to go with a local caddie.
"We came into the day kind of trying to figure it out and I was going to decide afterwards but I think I am going to go to a local caddie because they know so much," said Haylee, who sits at one-over, six off the pace.
"But my dad was able to kind of walk to get some notes and feel it out so we could make that decision.
"He's willing to do anything that makes me happy and is best for me so he kind of came to me on the second hole and said I don't know maybe you should take the caddie."
For Spain's Marta Perez, who describes herself as a golfer who plays with passion and emotion, having someone on her bag who can read her is more important than reading greens.
And in her case father Jose knows best.
"My dad, he is my coach, he started coaching me when I was eight years old so this is special for me," said Perez.
"We had a discussion if it was better to have a local caddie tomorrow but I want to stick with our plan I think it is great that he is here, he knows me more than anyone.
"I think it is special for him to be here with me because we are going to remember this forever."

Though the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship has been part of the European Tour schedule since 2006, this week’s 14th edition takes on heightened status as part of the Rolex Series collection of tournaments offering a prize fund of at least $7 million.
Under the new European Tour schedule that backloaded most of its top events into the late summer and fall, the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship presented by EGA is the only Rolex Series event in the first half of the year.
It’s also the first European Tour event of any kind in 2019, as the circuit emerges from a four-week break after the South African Open and Alfred Dunhill Championship in December. Two more Middle East events follow with the Omega Dubai Desert Classic and the Saudi International.
The English pro, 27, and one of last year’s Ryder Cup heroes, seeks a third straight crown at Abu Dhabi, having emerged from a congested group on the final day two years ago and finishing two strokes clear of Ross Fisher in last year’s title defense.
It will be Fleetwood’s first start of 2019, hoping to resume a strong run in which he hasn’t finished lower than 16th in eight starts since early September. He followed up a 4-1 performance in Europe’s Ryder Cup triumph by placing runner-up at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship and took third in the final Race to Dubai season standings.
The former world No. 1 makes his third consecutive visit to Abu Dhabi, sharing runner-up honors in 2017 and adding a tie for ninth last year. In both cases, he had to work his way back up the leader board after an opening 72.
Johnson, 34, arrives off a share of fourth at the PGA Tour’s Sentry Tournament of Champions in Hawaii, where a second-round 74 dropped him from among the front-runners. The round included the PGA Tour’s first penalty of 2019, when he played the wrong ball from a hazard after a marshal told him the ball was his.
“That won’t ever happen again,” Johnson told reporters.
Back at No. 2 in the world rankings in a seemingly perpetual flip-flop with Justin Rose, Koepka, 28, never got on track in Hawaii in his first start back from the holiday break. He broke 70 just once at the Tournament of Champions on the way to a share of 24th.
Koepka returns to Abu Dhabi for the first time since 2014. He made an early departure that year, shooting 77-73 to finish below the cut line. Now, though, he’ll try to live up to his billing as a three-time major winner.
The two-time major champion once ruled Abu Dhabi, winning three times in his first five appearances. He remains the event’s only three-time champion, but has been inconsistent since then, with three top-six finishes but also three outside the top 25.
Kaymer, 34, will tee it up for the first time since last year’s European Tour finale in Dubai, where he tied for 55th in a 60-man field. It was a frustrating 2018 all around for Kaymer, who sat out four weeks in the spring with wrist problems and missed 12 cuts in 23 starts worldwide upon his return.
An emotional victory at his native South African Open helped bring Oosthuizen’s 2018 to a satisfying close, separating himself on the final day to become just the sixth man to put his name on both the Open trophy and the British Open’s Claret Jug.
Oosthuizen, 36, also tied for seventh a week later at the Alfred Dunhill Championship, giving him four top-10 finishes worldwide in his final five starts of the year. He’s played Abu Dhabi before, earning a share of second in 2009 behind Paul Casey, but this is his first visit since 2011.
The 45-year-old Englishman showed he’s still a factor by winning the Nedbank Challenge last November, out dueling Oosthuizen and Sergio Garcia on the final day to end a three-and-a-half-year victory drought that was his longest since a career slump in the mid-2000s. It was his 24th European Tour win.
Westwood shared runner-up honors in his 2008 debut at Abu Dhabi, but with just one top-15 finish there since. Over the past three years, he’s sandwiched a tie for eighth in 2017 between a pair of missed cuts.
One of just a handful of players who have competed every year since the tournament began, Stenson nonetheless remains in quest of his first victory at Abu Dhabi Golf Club. In fact, until last year’s debut of the NBO Oman Open it was the only Middle East event that Stenson hasn’t won.
Once a part-time resident of Dubai, Stenson, 42, has twice captured the tour’s season finale there, along with the 2007 Dubai Desert Classic and the 2006 Commercialbank Qatar Masters. He was runner-up in two of the first three years at Abu Dhabi, then didn’t have another top-10 until a tie for third in 2016.
The 28-year-old Englishman is tasked with following up a three-win season in 2018, which eventually left him 10th in the Race to Dubai standings. That fueled a rise from No. 130 in the world rankings to start last year into the top 50, earning his first Masters invitation.
It’s been an abrupt rise for Wallace, who first started to gain attention three years ago when he won six times on the developmental Alps Tour. That helped secure a place on Europe’s Challenge Tour, where a victory at the 2017 Portugal Open earned a promotion to the big circuit. Over the final five months of last year, he posted seven top-20 finishes in 13 starts.
Back woes ended Pepperell’s breakthrough 2018 on a sour note, managing just one round over the final two and a half months when he withdrew after one day of the tour’s season finale in Dubai. Before that, he hadn’t teed it up since winning the Sky Sports British Masters in October.
The 27-year-old Englishman also won the Commercial Bank Qatar Masters last spring and added runner-up finishes at the Portugal Masters and Aberdeen Standard Investments Scottish Open. That vaulted him into the top 40 of the world rankings for the first time, bringing a first Masters invitation to brighten his December.
Europe’s victorious Ryder Cup captain makes his fifth start since picking up his playing career after September’s Paris triumph. How he performs, though, figures to take a back seat in the conversation to the new piece of body art he likely won’t be showing off.
Making good on a promise to his players, Bjorn, 47, now has a small image of the Ryder Cup tattooed on his backside along with the 17½ to 10½ final score. While universally applauded by his players, most thought it wasn’t big enough. “He’s got plenty of space,” Ian Poulter quipped.

(Reuters) - Kim Si-woo reeled off five birdies in a six-hole stretch en route to the first-round lead at the Texas Open in San Antonio on Thursday.
The South Korean carded six-under-par 66 for a one-stroke advantage over Mexican Abraham Ancer, Venezuelan Jhonattan Vegas and Americans Chris Stroud and J.T. Poston at TPC San Antonio.
Kim's place at next week's Masters is already assured but the four players behind him all need to win on Sunday to punch the final ticket to the first major championship of the year.
Rickie Fowler and Jordan Spieth, among only a handful of the big names using the Texas Open to tune-up for the Masters, both shot 68 on an unusually benign day in a typically windy location.
Spieth more than most could do with a boost in confidence before heading to Augusta National, where his 2015 victory kicked off a major year that with a little luck could have ended with a calendar grand slam.
But he has been out-of-sorts this year so was in an upbeat mood after his round.
"Other than one three-putt it was kind of a bogey-free type round, putting myself in position on those approach shots to make par at worse," he told Golf Channel.
"Swing is getting there, putting stroke feels really good, it's progressing day to day.
"(I'm pleased with) the overall way I attacked the golf course to limit the amount of mistakes."
Fowler, second behind Patrick Reed at the Masters last year, was also pleased with his round.
"It's always nice to get out and make some birdies early, shake off some rust," said Fowler, who skipped last week's WGC-Match Play.
A strong week would also be a nice tonic for world number 61 Kim, who has struggled over the last month.
Starting his round at the 10th, he was plodding along at even par after seven holes, but birdied the next two with putts of five feet before slipping with a bogey at the first.
He responded magnificently with five birdies in the next six holes to grab the lead.
"If I'm reading (the greens) good I can putt well," he said.

RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. — Albane Valenzuela could have been teeing it up Wednesday in the inaugural Augusta National Women’s Amateur, where the contestants who survive the cut will play the final 18 holes on the fabled course where men will compete at the Masters next week.
Valenzuela, a junior at Stanford and the fifth-ranked women’s amateur in the world, seriously entertained the invitation from the board of governors of the Augusta National Golf Club until she received what she considered a better offer for this week: her third start in the ANA Inspiration, the women’s first major of the year.
“Getting to tee off and play the same course as the world No. 1,” she said Tuesday, referring to South Korea’s Sung Hyun Park, “I think that’s the best experience you can get.”
Augusta National officials have trumpeted their amateur invitational as a grand stage for women’s golf. That overlooks the major originally known as the Dinah Shore, which has captivated young golfers since 1972. The tournament has cultivated indelible traditions like the winner’s leap into Poppie’s Pond and consistently provided significant exposure for top amateurs like Valenzuela, who used her 2016 debut here as a springboard to the Rio Olympics.
Augusta National didn’t admit its firstfemale members until 2012. And while it has since opened its course to boys and girls through the Drive, Chip and Putt contest and to amateur women, these inclusive gestures have ignored — and however unintentionally, undermined — the L.P.G.A., one of the longest-running women’s professional sports organizations.
The Drive, Chip and Putt contest, held the Sunday before the Masters, has siphoned television and other media coverage from the final round of the ANA Inspiration. And with the advent of the Augusta National Women’s Amateur, the spotlight on the best women’s players in the world has become more diffuse.
“I think it comes from a very positive place in Augusta — they want to do the right thing,” Valenzuela said. “It’s probably not my place to say, but it would have been great if both could have worked together to make them happen in different weeks, because you don’t want to get the spotlight off the L.P.G.A.”
The ANA Inspiration matters because the magnetic moments that attracted Valenzuela to the sport as a child didn’t involve Augusta National, which for most of its history has been so far out of the women’s orbit that it might as well have been on Mars.
“Ever since I’ve been a little girl I’ve seen all the girls jump in the pond,” Valenzuela said, adding, “This is the women’s Masters.”
On Wednesday, Jennifer Kupcho, a Wake Forest senior and the top-ranked women’s amateur, struck the opening drive of the new event at the Champions Retreat resort in Evans, Ga., the site of the first two rounds. Only the final round will be played at Augusta National.
Across the country Wednesday, Valenzuela grooved her swing on the Mission Hills practice range. Stacy Lewis, the 2011 ANA Inspiration champion, said she planned to extend a warm welcome to Valenzuela and the four other amateurs in the field: Patty Tavatanakit, Frida Kinhult, Rachel Heck and Xin Kou, who is also known as Cindy.
“I’m really proud of them,” said Lewis, the former women’s world No. 1 who recently returned to competition after the birth in October of her first child, a daughter. “If you want to play professional golf, you need to play in majors, and you need to see where your game stacks up and have that experience of playing in front of those big crowds.”
Valenzuela has advanced to the weekend in each of her previous starts in this event. If she misses the cut this week, she will not be idle over the weekend. Her consolation prize will be joining her Stanford teammates on Sunday at the Silverado Showdown, a collegiate women’s event in Napa.
Stanford is ranked fourth in the Women’s Golf Coaches Association poll and is jockeying with other top teams for seeding positions at next month’s N.C.A.A. championship. Another Stanford star, Andrea Lee, chose to play in Georgia this week.
Anne Walker, Valenzuela’s coach at Stanford, said in a telephone interview that she welcomed Augusta National’s move into the women’s game, describing it as “another great opportunity that’s opened up.”
But in its exuberance to grow the game, Augusta National big-footed more than the L.P.G.A. schedule. “There’s very little discussion about the timing of it as it relates to college golf,” Walker said.
She pointed out that Texas, which is ranked second behind the University of Southern California, competed in the Bruzzy Challenge this week in Texas without three of its top players: Emilee Hoffman, Agathe Laisne and Kaitlyn Papp, who are in Augusta. The Longhorns finished tied for seventh, their lowest finish of the season by three places.
Walker ultimately described the scheduling conflicts as “a great problem to have.”
But they are a problem, nonetheless.
When the Augusta National chairman, Fred Ridley, announced the new event last year, he said: “We think that to have one week where the future greats of the game and the current greats of the women’s game are all competing on a big stage is, it’s just very exciting.”
Referring to L.P.G.A. Commissioner Mike Whan, who was not consulted before the Augusta tournament was scheduled, Ridley added, “I think he also understands that in time it’s going to be a win for the L.P.G.A.”
Lewis said she would love to see the Augusta event played at a different time of year.
Referring to the amateurs, she added, “Maybe they could get a full tournament on Augusta National. Get a couple practice rounds and a three-round tournament there.”
Or better yet, the Augusta National members could find a way to welcome the 8-year-old girls and the 18-year-old amateursafterthey have grown into the best women players on the planet.
It’s a win-win for golf any time the best women mix with the best men, as Brittany Lincicome, a two-time ANA Inspiration champion, recently was reminded.
Lincicome spent two days last month at the PGA Tour’s flagship event in Florida, and she was shocked when players like Sergio Garcia and Rory McIlroy saw her behind the rope lines and came bounding over to ask if she would pose for selfies with them.
Lincicome, 33, has been slow to recognize that her start last year in a PGA Tour event in Kentucky trumped either of her victorious finishes here.
“I had no idea they knew who I was,” she said.
If the L.P.G.A. has to move the date of its first major to accommodate Augusta National, here’s one idea how Augusta National members could make the change palatable. They could extend an invitation to the women’s reigning major winners to compete alongside the men in the Masters’ par-3 contest. That would be more meaningful start than a flashy 18-hole finish to an amateur event.

Alice Dye, who teamed with her husband, Pete, to pioneer modern golf-course architecture and worked to promote the women’s game for more than half a century, died on Friday in Gulf Stream, Fla. She was 91.
Her death was announced by Dye Designs, the family’s company.
The Dyes designed dozens of venues, in the United States and abroad, many of them regularly ranked among the best in the world and frequently chosen to host professional tournaments.
That roster includes the stadium course atTPC Sawgrass, in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.;PGA West, near Palm Springs, Calif.;Whistling Straits, on Lake Michigan in Sheboygan, Wis.;the Ocean Course, on Kiawah Island in South Carolina;Harbour Town Golf Links, in Hilton Head, S.C.; andCrooked Stick, in Alice’s hometown, Indianapolis.
Their courses were generally known as Pete Dye designs, but Alice provided significant input, and her husband usually took her advice.
Their signature hole was the 17th at TPC Sawgrass, the home of the Players Championship. When Pete was unsure how to fill in sandy terrain he had hollowed out around the green for transfer to other spots on the course, Alice provided the solution.
“Originally, the water was just supposed to come into play on the right side, but we just kept digging,” the Golf Channel quoted Mr. Dye as saying. “And then one day Alice came out and said, ‘Why don’t you just go ahead and make it an island?’ So we did.”
That green, connected to the rest of the course by a slender land bridge, has tormented even the world’s greatest golfers and become one of the most recognized images in the sport.
When they were building the Ocean Course on Kiawah Island in 1990, Ms. Dye persuaded her husband to raise the fairways to harmonize them with the environment.
“Pete, I can’t see the ocean on the back nine,” she said, as related by The New York Times. “I don’t just want to hear it; I want to see it.”
Mr. Dye raised the fairways by six feet so that the ocean came into view. But that created an added challenge by exposing the course to unpredictable, sometimes strong winds.
Both husband and wife were avid golfers, but Ms. Dye was the more accomplished of the two; she won some 50 amateur titles as well as two United States Golf Association senior championships and two Canadian senior championships. She played on the United States’ victoriousCurtis Cupteam in 1970.
In 1983, Ms. Dye was the first woman admitted to the American Society of Golf Course Architects. In 1997, she became the first woman to serve as the society’s president. She received the PGA of America’s First Lady of Golf Award in 2004.
Ms. Dye championed forward tees that make formidable courses more playable for most women as well as for male players outside the pro ranks.
“I worked very hard on trying to get the two-tee system for women,” she told the PGA of America. “I was successful in getting the yardage down between 5,000 and 5,200 yards.”
“We’re total opposites,” Ms. Dye said when she and Mr. Dye were interviewed by PBS in 2012. “He’s artistic and I’m the practical one.”
On her death, Ron Whittenwrote in Golf Digest: “She was the more successful competitive golfer, with a supple swing. She was a better politician than Pete when it came to dealing with owners and regulators, more polished in presentations and communications. As a golf architect, she was the more knowledgeable of the two, teaching Pete how to read contour maps and handling most of his drawings.”
In his memoir, “Bury Me in a Pot Bunker” (1995, with Mark Shaw), Pete Dye wrote of his wife, “She may have taken a back seat to whatever publicity I’ve had over the last 30 years, but everyone in the golf industry knows how important her contributions have been, since she has such an intuition for what makes a golf course challenging but playable.”
Alice O’Neal was born in Indianapolis on Feb. 19, 1927, to Perry and Lucy (Holliday) O’Neal. Her father, a corporate lawyer, was an avid golfer.
Alice developed her smooth swing at a local country club junior class and began winning tournaments as a teenager.
She met Mr. Dye when they were students at Rollins College, in Winter Park, Fla., where she was captain of the women’s golf team and also played on the men’s squad along with Pete. Alice graduated in 1948, but Pete dropped out. They were married in 1950 and settled in Indianapolis.
The couple were selling insurance there in the mid-1950s when they decided to pursue golf-course design. They advanced their knowledge of the profession when they toured Britain in 1963 and visited numerous courses.
Alice Dye is survived by her husband; their sons, Perry and Paul Burke (known as P.B.) Dye; two grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Both sons are golf architects with Dye Designs.
Ms. Dye looked back on her career in a book of her own, “From Birdies to Bunkers: Discover How Golf Can Bring Love, Humor, and Success Into Your Life” (2004), also written with Mr. Shaw.
Into her 80s, she offered insights for women who play golf.
“Because they have to tee off last on so many holes, a lot of women get self-conscious and worry that everyone is analyzing or judging their golf swing,” she told The Times in 2012. “That’s not true. They might be looking at their shoes or their hat. Most men don’t know enough about the golf swing to analyze it.”

LONDON — President Trump has implied that a golf course owned by the Trump Organization in Scotland helps cement the United States’ relationship with Britain, just a few days after a Scottish court ruled that the company had to pay expenses in a failed lawsuit.
“Very proud of perhaps the greatest golf course anywhere in the world,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday, adding, “Also, furthers U.K. relationship!”
Very proud of perhaps the greatest golf course anywhere in the world. Also, furthers U.K. relationship!https://t.co/3xTzzJH6Iq
The Trump International golf course near Aberdeen, in northeastern Scotland, was ordered on Wednesday to cover the Scottish government’s legal costs after the company was unsuccessful in its attempts to halt a North Sea wind power development.
Mr. Trump’s company had argued that the wind turbineswould mar the viewfrom the golf course.The case went to theSupreme Court of the United Kingdomin December 2015, where the company lost, setting up the ruling about who should pay costs.
The exact sum of the reimbursement that the Trump Organization now has to pay has not been disclosed. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The president’s tweet prompted bafflement and concern among some legal and ethics experts.
Thomas Lundmark, a professor of law at the University of Hull, in northern England, said in a telephone interview on Monday that the tweet “made me curious.”
“I don’t know what he’s talking about,” Mr. Lundmark added. “Does it further a relationship for him? For the United States? For us? How?”
Though the ruling in Scotland was against Mr. Trump’s company, Mr. Lundmark suggested that there were constitutional and ethical concerns.
The American Constitutionprohibits the president from accepting paymentsfrom foreign and domestic governments. Mr. Trump owns golf courses, hotels and other properties that are frequented by foreign and domestic government officials.
Some have claimed that Mr. Trump’s promotion of his properties while president amount to aviolation of the emoluments clausesin the Constitution.
“He’s turned companies over to other people to manage, but he is still a beneficiary,” Mr. Lundmark said.
John Linarelli, an American professor of commercial law at Durham University in northeast England, said that there was “plausible concern” that the constitutional rules were being violated.
It was also, he added, “a question of ethics.”
“You want him to have our interests in mind when he’s managing foreign policy — not his own,” Mr. Linarelli added.
Walter M. Shaub Jr., whoresigned his postas the United States government’s top ethics watchdog in July 2017, said in a tweet on Saturday that Mr. Trump’s comment was the president’s “most explicit commingling of personal interests and public office to date.”
“This is shameless, corrupt and repugnant presidential profiteering,” he added. “This is an invitation to graft.”
Mr. Shaub is now a senior adviser for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit advocacy group.
The groupsued Mr. Trumpin January 2017, arguing that he was “illegally receiving payments from foreign governments.” The lawsuitcleared a hurdle last Marchwhen a federal judge in Maryland refused the Justice Department’s request to dismiss it.
In July,another lawsuitaccusing the president of violating the Constitution by maintaining a financial interest in his company’s Washington hotel was allowed to move to the evidence-gathering stage.

AUGUSTA Ga. (Reuters) - Rory McIlroy will begin his latest quest to complete the career grand slam of golf's four majors when he tees off alongside American Rickie Fowler and Australia's Cameron Smith at the Masters starting on Thursday at Augusta National.
It will be McIlroy's fifth attempt at the Masters to complete his collection of major titles and is perhaps his best chance yet as the Northern Irishman enters the week as the hottest player on the planet.
McIlroy's grouping, which will be the 15th of 29 to take the course, will start their round at 11:15 a.m. ET (1515 GMT) and follow the threesome of four-times champion Tiger Woods, China's Li Haotong and Spaniard Jon Rahm around the course.
Looking to join Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Woods as winners of the career grand slam, McIlroy enters the year's first major in top form.
With a top-six finish in each of the six stroke play events he has played this year, including a triumph at The Players Championship three weeks ago, McIlroy is a popular pick to make amends for his final-round letdown last year.
McIlroy, whose grouping will be the last out on Friday at 2 p.m. ET behind the Woods threesome, started three shots back of eventual champion Patrick Reed entering the final round in 2018 but closed with two-over 74 to finish in a share of fifth place.
Three-times champion Phil Mickelson will play the opening two rounds alongside 2013 U.S. Open champion Justin Rose and 2017 PGA Championship winner Justin Thomas in the penultimate grouping on Thursday.
The final trio on Thursday will bring together Jordan Spieth, Paul Casey and Brooks Koepka.
World number two Dustin Johnson will play the opening two rounds with Bryson DeChambeau and Australian Jason Day while reigning champion Patrick Reed will play alongside fellow American Webb Simpson and Norwegian amateur Viktor Hovland.

(Reuters) - Jennifer Kupcho's bogey-free run finally came to an end but the American hung on for a one-stroke lead after the second round of the inaugural Augusta National Women's Amateur on Thursday.
Kupcho, the world's top-ranked amateur, shot a one-under par 71 at Champions Retreat Golf Club in Evans, Georgia, leaving her at five under on the week going into the final round on Saturday at Augusta National Golf Club ahead of next week's Masters.
The 21-year-old American, fresh off what she called her first "perfect" round, started on the back nine and was cruising along at three-under for the day until her 14th hole, the par-four fifth, where she made her first bogey of the week.
Kupcho then made bogey at her penultimate hole before a par at the last left the overnight co-leader one shot clear of Mexico's Maria Fassi (70), whose roller-coaster round included five bogeys, five birdies and an eagle.
Thailand's Pimnipa Panthong (70) and Americans Sierra Brooks (70) and Kaitlyn Papp (69) were a further shot off the pace.
American Zoe Campos, who at 16 is one of the youngest players in the field, started the day in a share of the lead but mixed six bogeys with three birdies for a three-over 75 that left her four shots behind Kupcho.
Only the top-30 players after two rounds advanced to the final round, when they will become the first women to compete at the home of the Masters, but all 72 players in the field can play a practice round at Augusta National on Friday.

PYLOS, Greece — On the southwestern Peloponnese coast of Greece, in walking distance from the beach, Thodoris Poulis, a construction foreman, pointed up recently at half a dozen newly built homes on the hillside, each with a sweeping view of the Bay of Navarino.
“The older sort of development with a few small houses is going away,” he said, “and we’re getting more large stand-alone homes — expensive builds, in the style of villas.”
As he spoke, he was overseeing work on what will become just such a villa; dubbed the Lemon Project, this home near the town of Pylos will have a pool, a sea view and landscaped gardens, complete with citrus orchard.
The developer of that property, Iliopoulos Real Estate and Constructions, is a small family business run by two brothers, Minas and Vasilis Iliopoulos. Until recently, their business usually involved building or renovating modest homes on plots owned by others here in the Messenia region.
But with the Lemon Project, they have become developers, buying the land themselves and building a luxury home that they will put on the market for about 800,000 euros, or about $900,000.
Part of the reason they can do this can be found in a very different construction site only a short distance away.
In the hills above Pylos, large machines crack and pulverize boulders clawed from the ground.
Dwarfed by rising slopes on either side, they are carving out what will become an artificial lake — an irrigation reservoir for two new 18-hole golf courses. When completed in 2021, the courses will unfold over 370 acres across the hilltops and provide golfers with sweeping views of the olive groves and the sea below.
These courses, designed by the two-time Masters championJosé María Olazábaland christened Navarino Hills by the developer,Temes, are a major undertaking by any standard. Yet they are only the latest project on which the company has broken ground in a multifaceted effort to remake this onetime sleepy region into a world-renowned golf and holiday destination under the brand Costa Navarino.
Alongside its flagship Navarino Dunes resort, with its two five-star hotels, extensive spa and myriad other amenities, Temes has already built two other 18-hole signature golf courses in the area: The Dunes Course, which opened with the resort in 2010, and The Bay Course, opened in 2011 and just below Navarino Hills.
They are responding to what has become a truism in the golf course business. “With golf courses there is the following issue: One equals almost none,” said Achilles Constantakopoulos, the chairman of Temes. He cited a survey by the International Association of Golf Tour Operators that found that only 15 percent of dedicated golfers would consider visiting a new destination with just one golf course. That figure rises to 75 percent with three golf courses and to 100 percent with five.
“What’s important is not just to have a golf course, but to be considered a golf destination,” Mr. Constantakopoulos said, “then it becomes a decision-making factor.”
Ambitious as it may be, turning Messenia into a place that lures high-spending golfers away from other more established destinations is just one aspect of the company’s multipronged strategy. It is one that seeks to not only increase tourism to Messenia, but to do so year-round — an almost unheard-of goal in a country where the overwhelming majority of visitors arrive between June and September. Golf serves that purpose, by providing a reason to visit outside the summer months.
Another key aim is for some of the newly acquired visitors to purchase homes, becoming regular contributors to the local economy for years to come.
That strategy appears to be bearing fruit beyond the carefully manicured grounds of Costa Navarino.
In the Iliopoulos brothers’ office in Pylos, lined with images of properties for sale, a cluster of golf clubs stands in a corner. On the shelf above it sits a glass container half filled with golf balls printed with the company’s logo. Neither of the brothers plays golf.
Putting up a development like the Lemon Project would have been unthinkable only a few years ago; in 2013, thanks to the uncertainty swirling around Greece’s fiscal crisis and with domestic bank lending effectively nonexistent, the construction business in the Messenia area had ground almost to a halt. But things soon turned around.
“Since 2016 we have been on an upward trajectory,’’ said Minas Iliopoulos. “We have been growing every year. And tourism is on the rise. Quality tourism.”
The brothers’ optimism does not appear to be unfounded. Savills Greece, a real estate agency, said in a statement that “the second home market in Messenia has changed drastically in the last 10 years.”
“Interest for a second home in the area has significantly risen,” the agency said, “and thus prices have also gone up, since owners see continued demand.”
According to Savills Greece, average prices for second homes in Messenia are generally between €230 and €325 per square foot, with prices exceeding €465 per square foot for “very special properties.” While Savills notes that in many cases sellers’ initial asking prices are overly optimistic, “above average prices have shown significant growth in the last decade.”
Temes’s grand plan to remake the region is one that has been decades in the making, essentially the vision ofVassilis Constantakopoulos, Achilles Constantakopoulos’s father and the founder of Temes. He died in 2011, but is still referred to as the Captain by many Temes employees and Messenians alike.
Born to a poor family in the Messenian village of Diavolitsi, Vassilis Constantakopoulos left his homeland for Athens during the 1946-49 Greek Civil War at around 13 years of age.
By the mid-1970s he had founded the shipping company Costamare, through which he amassed a great fortune. In the 1980s he began regularly visiting his homeland and buying land piecemeal, laying the groundwork for what would become today’s Costa Navarino.
“His vision was to create a new tourism destination in the Mediterranean and in parallel to give work to the people, so they wouldn’t need to leave as he had left at 12, 13 years old,” Achilles Constantakopoulos said. “He had a very strong feeling for the people of the area. And he saw that Messenia as an area had great potential for tourism which was not being realized.”
In the meantime, one of the most significant obstacles to tourism in the region — its historically poor transportation links — has been largely overcome.
Once a five-hour journey along winding country roads, the completion of a major infrastructure project has turned the drive from Athens into a two-and-a-half hour trip along a highway that slices through the mountainous landscape via tunnels and bridges.
And the airport of the city Kalamata, 45 minutes from Pylos, now receives more than 1,300 international flights a year — up 450 percent from a decade ago — in part because Temes has spent millions to woo international carriers. In 2012 the airport was renamed the Captain Vassilis Constantakopoulos Kalamata International Airport.
“Messenia is one of the few destinations in Europe which is at once easily accessible but unspoiled,” Achilles Constantakopoulos said. “This combination is very rare.”
With Messenia now on the international tourism map, in 2017 Temes rolled out another key stage of its plan: offering upscale holiday homes for purchase.
The Navarino Residences were the first to go on the market. The luxury villas, located at Navarino Dunes, are fully customizable, have a minimum floor space of 4,300 square feet and a starting price of €2.4 million. Of the 30 initially offered, 18 have been purchased. Another 20 will be offered at a later date.
Their architectural design is based in part on a 19th-century building preserved on the Costa Navarino grounds, which was recently renovated to become a luxury villa.
Navarino Residences were followed in 2018 by Navarino Apartments. At the lower end of the company’s planned real estate offerings, these 1,300-square-foot units have a starting price just under €500,000.
In both cases, buyers get multiple benefits from owning a property integrated into the resort, including free access to the complex’s amenities and rent-sharing programs that will generate profit when they are away.
Yet even with the interest that Costa Navarino has generated, second-home prices in the immediate vicinity of the resort remain significantly below those in more established Greek holiday destinations such as the Cyclades or Corfu. In these areas, according to Savills, average prices for holiday homes are about €370 per square foot; luxury homes go for above €740 per square foot.
And further afield, around Kalamata and toward the eastern boundary of Messenia near the Mani Peninsula, many properties remain accessible to buyers of even modest means.
“There are excellent opportunities anywhere in the Messenian Peloponnese,” said Mary O’Connor, who for 20 years has run a real estate business in Kalamata with her husband, specializing in the second-home market. “Except for around Pylos,” she added, where properties have become scarce. But even there, she said, “there are a few good plots left.’’
In other areas and villages, Ms. O’Connor said, plots and fixer-upper houses can still be bought for prices below €50,000.
George Elliott, 67, bought a fixer-upper in Messenia in 2001 and now lives there about six months a year. His house was once the village’s olive press. (The basement still has lots of the original machinery.) He is grateful that the Costa Navarino development has helped bring decent transportation to the area.
He would happily play golf, too. But he plays only in London, where he said it costs about $17. The Costa Navarino golf courses are just too expensive for him. “I don’t have that kind of pension,” he said.

AUGUSTA Ga. (Reuters) - Bryson DeChambeau has earned the "mad scientist" nickname for his calculated approach to golf and may need to spend some extra time in his quirky laboratory to find a winning formula at this week's Masters.
DeChambeau, a physics major who previously used a since-banned compass to help read greens, has five wins on the PGA Tour but taming Augusta National will prove the toughest test yet for the American world number six.
The year's first major does not provide players with green-reading books, and that could put DeChambeau well out of his comfort zone given the highly-contoured greens at Augusta National that can frustrate the game's best putters.
"I have to work a little harder to get some insight into some things than other places, but that's fine," DeChambeau told reporters on Monday.
"I mean, that's a part of the process, and I think the person who digs it out of the dirt the most should have a little bit of an advantage and I think that's where it's actually a positive thing."
DeChambeau, who finished as the low amateur at the Masters in 2016 before joining the PGA Tour the following year, already has a win this season but knows he faces a difficult challenge going into Thursday's opening round.
Unlike many of his competitors, DeChambeau will not be able to rely on the detailed notes they have modified over the years after logging countless practice and tournament rounds at Augusta National.
DeChambeau made no secrets when asked about what impact the lack of green-reading books could have on him this week.
"Now I practiced trying to understand what one percent is, what two percent is, based on my eyes," said DeChambeau. "Is it as precise as the greens books? Absolutely not. We still have to feel and sense with our eyes what it's going to do.
"That's really all I can do and I have to practice a lot more hitting breaking putts, because I can't just bring out my compass and go, oh, it's 3 percent and here it is. I have to look at and walk around and go, okay, I'm acclimated to 3 percent."

AUGUSTA, Ga. — The Mexican flag has been waving proudly at Augusta National with amateur Alvaro Ortiz taking the baton from Maria Fassi and carrying it into this week's Masters with his eyes on a Green Jacket.
After a four-decade absence, Augusta National is getting a fresh taste of Latin flair served up by a new generation of Mexican golfers primed to battle for titles.
Fassi provided Ortiz with a tough act to follow by finishing runner-up to Jennifer Kupcho in the inaugural Augusta National Women's Amateur after a stirring back-nine battle with the American on Saturday.
Now Ortiz steps into the spotlight as he becomes the first player from his country since Victor Regalado in 1979 to play at the Masters and only the second Mexican amateur following Juan Antonio Estrada who featured at Augusta from 1962-64.
The determined Ortiz finished runner-up in the two previous Latin America Amateur Championship tournaments before this year claiming the title and his Masters invite at the third attempt.
"It was a huge deal for my family and me for sure and the whole country," said Ortiz, who will turn professional immediately after the Masters. "When I came back to Mexico after winning, it was all cheers and people were so happy.
"People were so proud that I was going to be able to put a Mexican flag up there."
Ortiz said he had received plenty of advice ahead of Thursday's opening round with most people telling him to relax and enjoy the experience.
But the 23-year-old, showing no fear and more than a little cockiness, said he would be trying to win a Green Jacket like everyone else, although admitting if given a chance to sign for a top 10 right now he would take it.
"In my mind, I'm out here to compete and I want the Green Jacket," he said. "I think every player is thinking like that.
"Of course, winning the low amateur would be nice," he said referring to the Silver Cup awarded to the lowest amateur to make the cut.
"Making the cut would be a really good finish too but if you give me a top 10 right now, I'll sign it for sure."
While a top 10 finish would guarantee a Masters invite next year, Ortiz is soaking up every moment of his experience now.
He will spend Monday night in the Crow's Nest above the Augusta National clubhouse, where amateurs have traditionally slept, and promised to bite into the local delicacy -- a pimento cheese sandwich -- at some point.
"Yeah, everybody was talking about that," Ortiz said with a smile. "Actually, I received more arguments about the... chicken barbecue sandwich, which I think is pretty good. I already tried that one, but I'll have to try the pimento cheese."

AUGUSTA, Georgia — Women will have their day at Augusta National on Saturday when the golf club, once ground zero in the gender equality battle, hosts the final round of the Augusta National Women's Amateur (ANWA).
The word historic has been attached to the first ever competitive women's round at the home of the Masters and the occasion will be given the full treatment, with NBC providing live coverage and Augusta National rolling out the pomp, ceremony and tradition that is its trademark.
The image of 30 women competing at a club which only seven years ago did not have a single female member is being held up as another small victory for equality.
Martha Burk, who put Augusta National's all-male membership policy under a microscope, will not be celebrating mocking the ANWA as a public relations stunt but the 77-year-old activist says she and her group of protesters will take credit for sparking the little progress that has been made.
"I just don't have any doubt about that at all if no public pressure or international spotlight had been shined on it thanks to us they would still be doing the same thing and getting away with it," Burk told Reuters. "I'm sorry I'm just not buying it.
"People are going to say it is just sour grapes because she did not succeed in her crusade back in 2003 but I think what progress we are seeing is a direct result of what we did."
What Burk did 16 years ago was put unwanted scrutiny on Augusta National Golf Club and its gender discrimination policy.
Founded by Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts and opened for play in 1933, Augusta National became a sanctuary for some of the world's most powerful men and for decades remained unmoved by outside forces and events.
It would be nearly 80 years until Augusta National relented in 2012, with former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and financier Darla Moore becoming the first women to don the iconic Green Jackets that distinguish members and Masters champions.
Holding up Augusta National as a relic of the past, the National Council of Women's Organisations spearheaded by Burk took their fight to the club's doorstep during 2003 Masters week, drawing the attention of the world's media.
Augusta National could not stop the protest but was able to keep it well away from the club's doorstep, a court order restricting the event to a muddy field out of view of patrons and sponsors.
The protest failed to draw the numbers it hoped for, collapsing into a near farce with clowns and an Elvis impersonator getting as much attention as Burk herself.
While the mood was light, the seriousness of the issue was underscored by Burk having to demonstrate wearing a bullet proof vest while the FBI tapped her phone chasing down death threats.
"If social media had been around I would be dead," Burk said. "I got so many death threats over Augusta, that day I was wearing a bullet proof vest and I had hired body guards because people were just rampant about it and I really do believe if social media had existed somebody would have tracked me down and shot me."
ABSOLUTE SECRECY
One of the world's most exclusive clubs, Augusta National operates in absolute secrecy. Even the smallest detail such as who dry cleans the Green Jackets is classified.
The club's most heavily guarded secret, however, is its membership and when Burk was leaked a list of the 300 Green Jackets her group mounted a campaign urging consumers to boycott Masters sponsors.
Her organization also facilitated two sex discrimination lawsuits against Smith Barney, a division of Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley, whose CEOs were Augusta members, and collected $79 million in settlements.
It was that legal action, Burk believes, that produced the first cracks in Augusta National's resolve.
"I did not feel particularly defeated," said Burk, reflecting on her 2003 protest. "I know people expected me to go crawl into a hole and never come out because we weren't successful but we just kept trucking along.
"We had a list of all the members and the companies they were affiliated with and I think the club knew that they weren't going to be the last two lawsuits.
"I knew you could not put that genie back in the bottle it was going to come up as it has every year.
"I knew that eventually something would come of it.
"Will they ever be true converts as opposed to Easter Sunday Christians? I don't know but at least they are making the right noises.
"It is never going to go away for them."

(Reuters) - Back at the site of the biggest win of her career, and also her greatest heartbreak, Lexi Thompson used a hot putter to finish a stroke behind leader Ally McDonald after the first round of the ANA Inspiration at Mission Hills in Rancho Mirage on Thursday.
McDonald, who has just three career top-10 finishes on the LPGA Tour, carded a four-under-par 68 to top the leaderboard in the first women's major of the year.
Fellow American Thompson birdied the par-five 18th to join South Koreans Ko Jin-young and Kim Hyo-joo and Swede Linnea Strom on 69.
Defending champion Pernilla Lindberg of Sweden battled to a 73, one shot better than American Michelle Wie, who was five over early before righting the ship with four straight birdies.
An ample serving of rough greeted the 112-woman field and Thompson found it more often than she would have liked on a day when her driving was not the straightest.
"It was a little bit of an up-and-down day," she told reporters. "I hit some great shots and then hit some poor ones off the tee.
"I made some great putts, which is always a big confidence booster for me. Overall I could have hit it better, but still not complaining."
Thompson's lone major victory came at Mission Hills in 2014, but three years later she was in tears after incurring a four-stroke penalty for a putting rules violation on the way to losing a playoff to Ryu So-yeon.
Ko, meanwhile, continued the sizzling form that has made her the hottest player in the women's game over the past few weeks.
In her last three LPGA starts she finished second, first and third, and it was another good day at the office on Thursday.
Asked what the key to her round was, Ko kept it simple.
"I hit the fairway, so hit the green, two-putt, that's it," she said.
Compatriot Kim also came into the event in form after shooting 62 in the final round of the Kia Classic on Sunday.
"I really wanted to be able to take that level into this week of a major," she said. "Everything really came together today."
Leader McDonald, who birdied all four of the par-fives, was determined not to let herself get carried away.
"In this position that I've never been in it's so easy to get ahead of yourself," she said.
"I know that on the very first day a great round is awesome, but there is so much more golf left to play.
"I'm just excited to put a good round together in a major, and look forward to teeing it up again tomorrow."

AUGUSTA, Georgia — When Justin Rose launches his 14th bid for Masters glory this week he will be armed with expert knowledge of Augusta National's notoriously tricky greens and something perhaps even more valuable -- a good friend.
After three months apart, the newly re-minted world number one told reporters on Monday that he was pleased to be reunited with long-time caddie Mark 'Fooch' Fulcher, who had to take time off following heart surgery in January.
"I feel like we've learned together so much here, I wouldn't expect a nugget of information I don't know to come out during practice," Rose said after a practice round.
He added that Fulcher's presence would be especially valuable in the later rounds of the tournament, when emotions run high.
"It's when the going gets tough," Rose said. "We have so many positive experiences out there under pressure that we can draw on together."
The 2013 U.S. Open champion has clinched a top-10 finish on five separate occasions at The Masters.
But perhaps no single outing at Augusta National was more formative to Rose than his devastating playoff loss to Spaniard Sergio Garcia in 2017.
"I felt like that was the first major I've been close to and not won, really, like a heartbreaker," Rose said. "I think I took comfort in the fact that you can't get through a career without something like that happening."
It was far from the only setback. Injuries to his shoulder and back nagged at Rose in 2014 and 2016, respectively, and he pulled out of an August 2018 World Golf Championships event citing joint tightness.
The 38-year-old Olympic gold medalist has had time to bounce back, notably netting his 10th PGA tour victory in January with a two-shot win over Adam Scott at Torrey Pines.
Rose, who took a month off in February after missing the cut at the Saudi International, is now looking to add to his trophy case with a second major win.
"I would take four, as long as it's one of each," Rose said. "That would be awesome. That would be enough."

An undocumented immigrant who worked at one of President Trump’s golf clubs in New Jersey for years and recently spoke out about her experience will attend his State of the Union address after being invited by her Democratic congresswoman, the woman’s lawyer and the congresswoman’s office said Wednesday.
The undocumented immigrant, Victorina Morales, had worked as a housekeeper at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., since 2013, and spoke to The New York Times aspart of an article published last month. The report revealed that the president’s company — the Trump Organization — was, for years, employing people at the golf club who are in the country illegally.
In a brief interview on Wednesday, Ms. Morales said that on the advice of her lawyer, she stopped going to work on Dec. 4, two days before the Times article was published. Still, the lawyer, Anibal Romero, said that neither he nor his client had received notice that she had been fired. He said Ms. Morales’s employment status with the golf club was not entirely clear.
Since leaving her job, Ms. Morales, who is from Guatemala, has campaigned for rights and fair treatment for undocumented immigrants. On Wednesday, she said she was pleased to have been invited tothe State of the Union, that she has accepted the invitation and that she was “very proud because I am going to raise my voice for all of us immigrants.”
“I’m not scared to show my face,” she said, speaking in Spanish. “I am not speaking for me, I’m speaking on behalf of millions of undocumented immigrants who live in the United States.”
The congresswoman, Bonnie Watson Coleman, represents the New Jersey district in which Ms. Morales lives. The news that Ms. Morales had been invited to attend Tuesday’s State of the Union address as Ms. Watson Coleman’s guest was reported byThe Washington Poston Wednesday.
“Immigrants by and large are hardworking, trustworthy and skilled people who simply want to work and build better lives here,” Ms. Watson Coleman said in a statement. “For years these kinds of people were loyal and dedicated enough to be Trump Organization employees. I hope that in his State of the Union address, Donald Trump will finally acknowledge the real face of immigrants in this country — women and children fleeing violence; law-abiding, taxpaying people who would do almost anything to be Americans. And if he can’t, I’ve invited Victorina so that he may look her in her eyes to tell his lies to a familiar face.”
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday evening.
Mr. Trump has made border security and protecting jobs for Americans cornerstones of his presidency, and his insistence on building a border wall led to the recent partial government shutdown. He has labeled illegal immigration “a major, major problem,” and pledged to build a border wall while his administration has carried out workplace raids and payroll audits.
The Times article, published Dec. 6, said undocumented immigrants had been employed for years at the Trump National Golf Club as housekeepers, landscapers and kitchen staff. It also said they were kept on the payroll even though management was aware they had used phony documents to secure employment, as is common among undocumented immigrants.
Ms. Morales previously told The Times that a manager at Bedminster had helped her secure a new fake Social Security number and legal permanent-residency card after telling her that those on file had expired.
Since the article was published, about a dozen workers deemed ineligible to work in the United States because they lacked legal immigration status have been terminated at the Bedminster club, according to people familiar with the matter.
Another dozen were fired at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County, N.Y.,this month, a development first reportedby The Washington Post.
The Trump Organization also said late Tuesday that it wasputting in place a system to weed out undocumented immigrants who try to get jobsat its properties.
“I must say, for me personally, this whole thing is truly heartbreaking,” Eric Trump, an executive vice president with the Trump Organization, said in the statement on Tuesday. “Our employees are like family, but when presented with fake documents, an employer has little choice.”
He said that hiring undocumented immigrants was not a problem unique to the Trump Organization, and that it “demonstrates that our immigration system is severely broken and needs to be fixed immediately.”

WASHINGTON — For Donald Trump, the rigid rules of golf are flexible, allowing for the kick of a wayward ball into a better location, skipping a putt that looks close enough. What's the big deal?
That is according to Rick Reilly, a former Sports Illustrated columnist who has just written the book "Commander in Cheat," which alleges Trump is guilty of all sorts of sins on the golf course.
In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Reilly laid out a number of accusations to support his view that the U.S. president's golf game is, well, not par for the course, particularly for a president who owns a string of golf resorts.
Among the charges: Playing with pros Tiger Woods, Dustin Johnson and Brad Faxon in November 2017, Trump hit two balls in the water on one hole but didn't charge himself any penalty strokes.
The pros all saw it happen, but just grinned their way through it. Why didn't they call him out for the violation?
"Because he's so fun and we want our own stories to tell about the cheating," Reilly said he was told.
At Winged Foot, a famous golf club in Westchester County, New York, Trump had a reputation among the caddies for kicking his ball into a better position so often that they called him "Pele," the former soccer star, Reilly said.
While Trump has in the past claimed a golf handicap of 2.8, meaning he typically will average three strokes over par over 18 holes, his handicap is actually about 10, said Reilly.
"This idea that Donald Trump is a great golfer - he's not," said Reilly. "He's good. He’s a 72-year-old man who’s a 10 handicap. That’s pretty good. But why isn’t that good enough?"
One time Democrat Hillary Clinton, who Trump defeated in the 2016 election, had her brother, Hugh Rodham, to play a round at Winged Foot but showed up wearing shorts and was told he had to have long pants, Reilly said.
Rodham ended up wearing Trump's rain pants in order to meet the dress code, and gave them back when he was done. This didn't sit well with Trump when he found out about it.
"Somebody tells Trump this and he was so mad he made the club buy him a whole new rain suit," said Reilly.
Reilly said the point of the book is to show what Trump is really like behind the scenes.
"Golf is a window into a guy’s soul and this gives a pretty good view of the guy," he said.
The White House declined to comment.

PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. — At last week’s Arnold Palmer Invitational, Phil Mickelson carded a 68 in the first round while chewing gum. The next day, without gum, he sprayed his shots all over the Bay Hill course and shot a 78.
A coincidence? Mickelson thinks not.
To boost his cognitive functioning, Mickelson, 48, started chewing gum during competition in January at the Desert Classic — and tied for second. Two starts later, chewing gum as he walked, Mickelson clinched his 44th PGA Tour title.
“The chewing aspect stimulates the frontal cortex,” said Mickelson, who couldn’t get his putter activated Thursday in the opening round of the Players Championship. Mickelson, the 2007 champion, had a four-putt from 25 feet on the par-3 third hole, which was his 12th of the round, for a triple-bogey 6 on his way to a two-over-par 74. That left him nine strokes behind the leaders, Tommy Fleetwood and Keegan Bradley, who each posted a 65.
“It didn’t help much today,” Mickelson said with a rueful laugh. But, to the amusement of his peers, Mickelson has no plans to give up the gum.
“I’ve seen him chomping on that gum, and I was wondering what he was doing,” Steve Stricker said. “Leave it to Phil, I guess, to come up with that.”
There is some actual science to Mickelson’s assertions. Studies have shown that chewing gum is associated with improved alertness and the ability to process new information, though the results are far from definitive. A 2011 study by psychologists at St. Lawrence University found that students who chewed gum and then discarded it performed demanding cognitive tasks like repeating numbers backward and solving complex logic puzzles better than those who did not chew gum.
Mickelson’s caddie and younger brother, Tim, said he could not speak to the science of gum chewing, but he could vouch for Mickelson’s improved focus. Last year, he said, Mickelson on occasion would ask him to pick a club for him to hit because he couldn’t gather his thoughts. An inability to focus hadn’t been an issue this year, Mickelson’s brother said.
In the copycat world of professional golf, where players have turned their searching minds to mouth guards, tobacco chewing and copper bracelets as performance aids, could Mickelson’s success this year spawn other gum chewers?
Any players tempted to make like Violet Beauregarde, the “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” character who obsessively worked the same piece of gum for months at a time, should consider themselves warned. Serge Onyper, who co-wrote the St. Lawrence University study, noted in an email on Wednesday that those who chewed gum for five minutes before getting rid of it benefited compared with those who did not chew gum at all. But, he wrote, “those who chewed the gum throughout the cognitive tasks did not benefit compared to those who did not chew gum.”
Mickelson, 48, said he chews two pieces per round, but would not divulge the type or brand. “It’s not on the market yet,” he said.
Gum comes with and without sugar, with caffeine and, now, infused with cannabidiol, or CBD, which has been used to treat a variety of symptoms, including joint inflammation. It is categorized by the tour as a dietary supplement and is not prohibited, though players are advised to use extreme caution when using it and other supplements because, in general, there is no guarantee that what’s on the label is what’s in the product.
Tiger Woods noted that Michael Jordan chewed gum when he played basketball and said he has chewed gum on occasion for a quick sugar boost. There have been other gum chewers in the game, notably Payne Stewart, a three-time major winner. In the 1980s, the golfer Hubert Green bestowed upon Tim Norris the nickname Pac-Man because he chomped gum the way the arcade game character gobbled ghosts.
Paul Azinger, NBC’s lead golf analyst, described Norris, the 1982 Greater Hartford Open champion, as “the greatest gum chewer in the history of golf,” a distinction that made Norris chuckle when it was recently relayed to him.
Norris described his gum chewing as “a nervous habit” and said he preferred the spearmint flavor “because it was green, and if I did accidentally drop it, it blended into the grass.”
After Norris left competitive golf and embarked on a college coaching career, “I kind of grew out of the habit,” he said.
Billy Horschel, the 2014 FedEx Cup champion, was forced to curb his gum habit recently when he started wearing a clear aligner on his upper teeth. Horschel described his gum chewing as “kind of a superstitious thing” but said it served a purpose.
“I could chew on it harder when I needed to work out some frustrations,” he said Thursday after signing for a 69.
Some players never stuck with gum chewing long enough for it to become habit-forming. It was not calming for Bubba Watson, who said, “I tried to do it to take my mind off things going on but I bit my tongue too much.”
And Stricker said, “I started chewing gum and all of the sudden I was building up tension in my jaws because I started really grinding on it.”
In 2017, Jordan Spieth chewed gum on his way to winning the British Open for his third major title.
“I did it for no intended reason,” said Spieth, whose swing coach, Cameron McCormick, offered him a piece of gum before his opening tee shot. He got off to a quick start and just kept chomping on it until after he was done with his post-round news conference.
Spieth hasn’t made gum chewing a habit, “but I think there’s something to it,” he said. “I could sit here and say Phil’s blowing smoke but this one makes sense. When you’re focused on chewing, that can take your mind off of golf and can kind of calm players a bit.”
If Mickelson is so sold on gum’s cognitive benefits, why didn’t he chew his standard two pieces during the second round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational, where he ended up missing the cut?
“I forgot,” he said.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Bryson DeChambeau seemed about as excited as a mad scientist gets as Masters week kicked off, which meant he stopped just short of jumping for joy.
Not to worry. The jump might come Sunday for DeChambeau, assuming the planets align, the morning dew on the golf ball is at proper levels and putts don't bounce off the flagstick.
If not, well, all bets are off.
Golf's most noted iconoclast — the only one in the field with irons that are all the same length — tees off in his third Masters not only with visions of a green jacket but a legitimate chance of being in the mix late Sunday afternoon.
And why not? DeChambeau has won five times in the past year, rising from 62nd in the world golf rankings to sixth while building a reputation as both a crafty calculator and steely closer.
Not only that, he discovered something last week — just what he won't say — that might make him just as effective with his short wedges as he has been with the rest of his game.
"I've had some disadvantages with a couple of the irons I've had for a little bit," DeChambeau said. "And just being able to practice and getting comfortable and seeing the ball flights come out the proper way for the first time ever in my life is pretty cool."
That's DeChambeau. Always tweaking, always studying.
He's called the mad scientist for a reason. DeChambeau's swing is a study in the science of single plane, he plays irons that are all the same length so everything can be repeatable, and he studies contours in greens like they were clues to where the late union leader Jimmy Hoffa is buried.
What he would like to be called is Masters champion. And that's why he was working last week with new wedges — still the same length as his other irons — in search of a breakthrough that might trim a shot or two off at Augusta National.
"I've been fortunate to win a lot of tournaments using the equipment that I've had so far and it's been great," DeChambeau said. "But there's always that little bit of room for improvement. So we've been working quite heavily this past week in trying to figure out some things that could give me an advantage this week."
What may not be an advantage for DeChambeau is that there's no green mapping book for players at the Masters. Instead of staring at diagrams of contours on a green to see how a putt breaks, he'll have to rely on looking at the contours themselves.
But he's got a plan for that, too, just like he has a plan for most things in his golf career.
"I have to practice a lot more hitting breaking putts because I can't just bring out my compass and go, oh, it's 3 percent and here it is," DeChambeau said. "I have to look at and walk around and go, 'OK, I'm acclimated to 3 percent.'"
If the calculations are all a bit too much to understand, don't worry. Arnold Palmer would have been confused, too, and he won four green jackets.
Technology, though, is the new wave in golf, and DeChambeau is its leader in the clubhouse. He uses words in conversation that are heard more often in physics classes than golf courses and talks about scientific advances in golf like other players might be discussing the latest in movies.
That includes spending more time than usual this week figuring out exactly what moisture on the clubface will do at Augusta National, where rain is forecast during the week. To make sure he's doing it right, DeChambeau sprays balls on the practice range with salt water to see how they react.
"That's going to affect the way the ball reacts on the face," he said. "You know, there's a percentage to that, and we have to account for that. If you don't, you're going to hit it to 30, 40 feet, instead of 10 feet."
It may be too much information for casual golf fans, or even many of DeChambeau's fellow pros. No one else has really embraced his thoughts on swing plane and single length irons, but DeChambeau says he hopes some children taking up the game try and adopt it.
For now, the 25-year-old is focused on his wedges and the greens at Augusta National. He first came here as an amateur in 2016 and thought he had a chance at winning before hitting it into the bushes on 18 on his second day, and only broke par one round last year before finishing in a tie for 38th.
Whatever happens, one thing is for sure.
If DeChambeau doesn't win, he can't just blame it on bad luck.

CAPE TOWN — Clifford van der Venter admits his own golf game is “pretty useless.” Nevertheless, he was drawn to one of South Africa’s most prestigious golf estates, stretching over 2,500 rolling acres with a Jack Nicklaus signature course, two full-size polo fields, three gyms and a winery.
Grapevines flank the boulevards. Zebra and antelope nibble grass on a small reserve.
After a fast-paced career in the corporate world, Mr. van der Venter, 54, enjoys strolling through the grounds of Val de Vie, a gated community 35 miles north of Cape Town that has been judged South Africa’s best for the past two years by New World Wealth, a market research group based in Johannesburg. He also feels extremely safe there.
Estate developments — often built in combination with upscale golf courses — are hugely popular among wealthier homeowners in South Africa, consistently outperforming the general market, largely because they offer a combination of amenities and, as at Val de Vie, state-of-the-art security.
An analysis of the sector in 2016 by Lightstone Property, a local valuations firm, identified approximately6,500estate developments across the country. These accounted for about 5 percent of all residential homes but more than 15 percent of the market value.
Only the United States, with a population six times as large, has more of what are known there as gated communities.
In a country with a long history of racial turmoil, the South Africa pattern invariably results in communities dominated by white people (only about 10 percent of South Africa’s population), with others effectively excluded by income. Mr. van der Venter, a person of color,was a senior executive at Caltex and British American Tobacco, among other companies, before retiring and moving here.
Many of the communities combine armed guards, cameras and electric fences with recreational facilities like golf courses and gyms. Some, such as Raptor’s View, near Kruger National Park in the northeastern part of the country, include wildlife reserves.
Basil Weinrich, a real estate consultant from Cape Town, said more than 40 percent of wealthy South Africans — defined as people earning more than about $70,000 a year— now either live or own property on security estates, a figure that is steadily rising.
Crime dominates South African life. On average, 56 people are murdered every day, according to the most recent police statistics, making it one of the most violent countries on earth, according to the United Nations.
The police recorded nearly 230,000 burglaries last year, or 625 daily. Some experts estimate that the true burglary figure is perhaps three times that high. Break-ins and car highjackings can quickly turn almost gratuitously violent, with victims beaten and raped if they do not quickly turn over valuables or open safes. Banks and high-end malls are routinely patrolled by guards holding automatic weapons.
“South Africans consistently rank crime among their top concerns, second only to unemployment,’’ said Andrew Faull, a senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies. But, he added, “although the middle class and wealthy South Africans may feel restricted by fear of crime, they are sigificantly less restricted than the poor majority.’’
For people who can afford to move from “bubble of security to bubble of security,” he said, life can be “quite easy.”
It was almost by accident that Mr. van der Venter became converted to this way of life.
For more than a decade he had owned a sprawling property in Cape Town, not perturbed by its long, dark driveway or ramshackle fencing. Then he took a job in the east coast city of Durban, moving into an estate development popular among his new colleagues.
Soon afterward, he said, he began feeling “mentally free.”
No longer did he need to worry about locking his doors at night. His wife and children could walk around the estate after dark. He became aware of a subtle fear that had pervaded his life and was now lifting.
Upon returning to Cape Town, he planned to move back into his old home. “But now you realized you had this fear,” he said. “We knew we were never going back.”
Instead, in 2010, he and his wife purchased property at Val de Vie near Paarl. It is protected by thermal cameras, 24-hour dog patrols and an electrified, wrought-iron perimeter fence.
“Safety is the main concern, of course, but you also get this incredible lifestyle,” Mr. van der Venter said.
Purchased in 2002 as a disused clay quarry, Val de Vie now has 1,500 completed homes, apartments and hotel rooms. A second phase of 1,000 units is under construction, according to the marketing director, Ryk Neethling. Vacant lots typically cost $15 to $20 per square foot, while homes go for $150 to $330 per square foot.
“Many residents who built in Phase One have already invested in Phase Two,” said Mr. Neethling, a former Olympic swimming champion, on a recent tour through the development. “They see the dust and construction sites and know that in a few years, it will look like this.”
Properties at Val de Vie range from individualized seven-acre small holdings (“Gentleman’s Estates”) to one-bedroom apartments designed by one of South Africa’s most prominent architects, Stefan Antoni. Most properties are family homes with gray roofs and large windows, conforming to a building code that is “flexible but ensures some consistency,” Mr. Neethling said.
Nate Foster, a cellphone tower developer from Boulder, Colo., moved into one of these homes in January. With five bedrooms, large glass-walled living areas and a 50-foot swimming pool, it cost less than $1 million. A comparable property back home, Mr. Foster said, would have cost three to four times as much.
He and his wife had been “really resistant” to lifestyle estates since relocating to Cape Town in 2015, Mr. Foster said, wanting “more of a cultural experience.” But “the realities of South Africa still exist,” he went on. “Keeping one eye open all the time wasn’t desirable.”
There’s also the convenience factor. Mr. Foster, a triathlete, said he can train more easily at Val de Vie before going to work. A new fitness center on the estate, the Yard, has an Olympic-size swimming pool and a gym run by John McGrath, a seven-foot Irishman who used to perform in strongman competitions at Coney Island in New York.
“What’s special about this place is the community,” said Mr. McGrath, who stays in shape by bending metal wrenches into hoops.
But like Mr. Foster, the overwhelming majority of residents at Val de Vie are affluent and white. About 15 percent are foreigners, mostly from Europe, Mr. Neethling said, adding that between 10 percent and 15 percent are nonwhite.
Adding more affordable housing options to the estate — still beyond the reach of all but the wealthiest South Africans — has helped broadened access without “contaminating” prices, said Mr. van der Venter. In fact, the apartments, introduced in 2014, have been among the most successful developments at Val de Vie, with the highest average value per square foot (approximately $165) and investment returns of 100 percent in just two years.
“I signed up to buy two but backed out,” said Mr. van der Venter, who also owns an office block on the estate. “You keep thinking this bubble is going to burst. Now I’m kicking myself.”
Even with South Africa’s weak economy having strained property prices over the past decade, residential estates continued to perform well, said Andrew Amoils from New World Wealth.
There was “massive growth” in the sector from 2000 to 2008, but it slowed after the global financial crisis, Mr. Amoils explained. Even so, he said, “it still consistently outperforms the general market.”
In recent years, there has been a pronounced trend of developers’ interspersing townhouses and apartments among larger houses, Mr. Amoils said. Obtaining permission to build new estates had become more difficult, particularly as concern about water use rose amid increasingly frequent droughts, and rising rates and taxes had made big homes less affordable.
Still, there was the safety issue. “People get used to living like this,” Mr. Amoils said.
On a recent evening, as the sun set above the polo fields, Chad Marthinussen and Chanell Classen, both 25-year-old doctors, returned to their rental apartment after work. “You can come home from a crazy shift to this prettiness and just switch off,” Ms. Classen said.
She grew up in Bonteheuwel, a working-class suburb outside Cape Town. She and Mr. Marthinussen are planning to marry. They both loved the estate’s security and relaxed atmosphere, but they also shared some ambivalence.
“If we have kids, we don’t know if we’d want them growing up here,” Mr. Marthinussen confessed. “It feels like a safe bubble. And that’s amazing, but the real world isn’t like this.”

(Reuters) - South Korean Kim Si-woo almost aced the same hole for the second day running en route to a one-stroke lead over Canadian Corey Conners in the third round of the Texas Open on Saturday.
A day after holing a nine-iron from 167 yards at the par-three 16th on Friday, Kim took dead aim with a seven-iron at the same hole, which measured 190 yards on Saturday.
His ball landed a couple of yards in front of the cup and nearly went in on the second bounce before settling four feet away.
Kim threw his club into the air and placed his hands on his head upon narrowly failing to pull off what would have been an astronomically unlikely feat.
"I saw that first bounce and then right at it. I thought going in for sure this time," Kim told Golf Channel. "Just missed it."
He also missed the birdie putt, but made amends by sinking a birdie from similar distance at the last for a three-under-par 69 at TPC San Antonio.
Conners shot 66 to jump into second place on 14-under while
American Charley Hoffman carded 64, the best round of the day, to vault within two shots of the lead on an afternoon that started rainy before clearing up by the back nine.
Kim, seeking to lead wire-to-wire, has two victories on the PGA Tour, notably the 2017 Players Championship. The 23-year-old is not the most consistent performer, but has shown he can beat anyone when on his game.
Conners has yet to win at the highest level, and is so low on the tour's pecking order that he had to run the gauntlet of a Monday qualifier -- competing for four spots -- just to get into the Texas Open.
Victory on Sunday would earn him the last spot in next week's Masters.
"I've managed my game really well," Conners said.
"I've struck the ball really solidly and I was able to roll in a few putts today. Gave myself a ton of chances, hit a lot of quality iron shots set up by some good tee balls."
Hoffman has four PGA Tour wins, including the 2016 Texas Open.
His 64 included seven birdies, along with an eagle at the par-five 18th, where he struck a superb three-wood from 290 yards that had an eye on the pin the entire way.
"Flushed it," said the laid-back Californian. "It landed way softer than I anticipated. Very lucky to leave myself an uphill 10-footer."

For eight years, it seemed to Margarita Cruz that the management at the Trump Organization’s golf club in Westchester County, N.Y., did not notice — or did not care — that the green card and Social Security card she had used to get hired were fake, purchased in Queens for about $120.
Ms. Cruz, a housekeeper, said she cleaned guest rooms, offices and shops at the club. She laundered sheets and pool towels. But that all ended this month, she said.
Ms. Cruz and about a dozen other employees — housekeepers, landscapers and a head chef — at the club, Trump National Golf Club, were fired Jan. 18 because they were in the country illegally, according to interviews with Ms. Cruz and the former workers’ lawyer.
The firings werefirst reported on Saturday by The Washington Post.
The New York Timesreported in Decemberthat undocumented immigrants had been employed at another club owned by the Trump Organization, the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., and that they were kept on the payroll for years even though management there had some knowledge of their fraudulent papers.
Several workers deemed ineligible to work in the country hadalready been fired at the Bedminster club, according to people familiar with the matter.
The employment of undocumented workers at Trump Organization properties runs counter to President Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric, which he has made central to his campaign and his presidency. He is currently in a heated political battle to build a wall along the border with Mexico, which he claims would stop drugs and crime. Evidencedoes not supportMr. Trump’s thesis.
There is nothing to indicate that Mr. Trump or Trump Organization executives knew about the workers’ immigration status at either golf club. But Ms. Cruz, 44, said she believed that management at the Westchester club knew about her immigration status before January.
Her papers were requested again two years ago, she said, not just when she was hired. Anibal Romero, who represents Ms. Cruz and 14 other former workers at the golf club, the majority of whom were fired Jan. 18, was stronger in his wording.
“I’m not buying that they didn’t know,” Mr. Romero said.
Neither Ms. Cruz nor the other former workers received benefits like health insurance or a pension, as other golf club employees did, Mr. Romero said. Most of his clients came into the country through Mexico, Mr. Romero said, and were originally from countries such as Mexico, Ecuador and Honduras.
“This was a two-tiered system,” he said. “The people who were legal and the people who are undocumented.”
He said the workers were fired by being individually called into a room by an executive, who read their names off a list.
The White House referred questions to the Trump Organization on Saturday. The Trump Organization and the Westchester golf club did not respond to requests for comment.
In a statement to The Post, Eric Trump, who manages the Trump Organization with his brother Donald Jr., said: “We are making a broad effort to identify any employee who has given false and fraudulent documents to unlawfully gain employment. Where identified, any individual will be terminated immediately.”
Ms. Cruz entered the United States in 2009 near Piedras Negras, Mexico, on the Texas border, she said, with a 12-year-old daughter and a 9-year-old son. Her parents had paid a coyote $11,000 for the trip.
She said that in Mexico she earned about $40 a week working at a restaurant. She started at $11 per hour at the golf club, and then got a raise to $14 per hour. She said she did not have any savings when she was fired because she had been paying back her parents.
Mr. Trump’s political rhetoric has been surprising, she said, because he would regularly come by the golf club before his election and give the workers $50 tips in cash.
“He would come over and say hello, ask your name and how long you had worked at the club,” Ms. Cruz said. “He would ask you how you liked the rug, or a picture on the wall, things like that.”
She added, “If he really did hate Latinos so much, why did he come over to talk to us?”
She said some of her colleagues had worked at the golf club for 18 years.
“I couldn’t understand why he started talking like that about Latinos now and why he fired us,” she said.
Mr. Romero said he is seeking federal and state investigations of the golf club to see if it had been exploiting the undocumented workers.

Jin Young Ko vaulted from fifth-ranked to No. 1 overall in the Rolex Women's World Golf Rankings on Monday, one day after the South Korean claimed her first major title.
Ko fired a 2-under-par round of 70 on Sunday to win the 2019 ANA Inspiration at Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage, Calif.
The 23-year-old Ko finished at 10-under 278 to become the fifth South Korean winner of the tournament.
Now, she's the fifth South Korean player to reach No. 1 status, joining Inbee Park, Sung Hyun Park, So Yeon Ryu and Jiyai Shin.
"Reaching World No. 1 is exciting and I cannot believe that I have achieved this honor," Ko said in a statement. "I always keep my focus on the golf course and on my playing, but to win a major championship and be called the best player in the world is absolutely a great honor. I want to thank my family, my caddie and my manager for all of their support."
Her title Sunday was Ko's second victory of 2019, as she also claimed the 2019 Bank of Hope Founders Cup in mid-March. With the win, she earned 625 points and extended her lead in the Race to the CME Globe, where she entered the tournament 177 points ahead of Nelly Korda (1,155).
Sung Hyun Park, supplanted at No. 1 after five weeks, struggled to a 6-over 78 to finish at 4 over in a tie for 52nd. She fell to second place, just ahead of Thailand's Ariya Jutanugarn -- who started the year at No. 1.
Australia's Minjee Lee and Japan's Nasa Hataoka round out the top five.
American Lexi Thompson, who finished third on Sunday, jumped three spots to No. 6.

Augusta, Ga. — While the Masters is renowned for attracting the world's top players, a busy PGA tournament schedule and a field of competitors perpetually in flux means you never know who else might be in the field at Augusta National.
First-timer Keith Mitchell likes it that way.
The 27-year-old American makes his Masters debut by virtue of securing his first PGA championship last month at the Honda Classic, claiming victory with a final, 15-foot birdie putt.
"There are forty-something events, there are going to be guys that get their first win every year," Mitchell told reporters on Monday.
"What's so great about our sport is the unknown, someone who you might have never heard of wins this week and then you might be able to follow him for the next ten years."
While the University of Georgia graduate played the Augusta National course as a college student, he is better acquainted with life among the throngs of spectators.
Of course, a practice round in the glare of The Masters spotlight changed that.
"There were probably more people watching me warm up on a Monday here than at a lot of tournaments I've played in my life," Mitchell said.
"I've always watched people and admired how they hit the shots and hit their wedges and the shapes of the drivers, and then I was the guy that people were watching."
With six top-10 career PGA finishes, Mitchell will look to establish his foothold in the year's first major, when The Masters kicks off on Thursday.
"I still kind of feel like a rookie and still feel just kind of in awe of the place," Mitchell said. "And I hope that never goes away."

SAN DIEGO — To be the best, you have to beat the best. That’s what Justin Rose did over the past four days to win the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines, protecting his status as the world’s top-ranked golfer.
After a shaky start Sunday that included three bogeys over his first five holes, Rose recovered to shoot a three-under-par 69 and beat his close friend Adam Scott by two shots. Rose conquered a field that featured 12 of the top 20 players in the world rankings to record his 10th PGA Tour victory, passing Nick Faldo for the most tour wins by a player from England in the modern era.
Rose, 38, finished with a 72-hole total of 21-under 267, a tournament record since the South Course was redesigned in 2003 and one shot off the overall record of 22 under shared by Tiger Woods (1999) and George Burns (1987). Scott birdied the final four holes to close out a 68 and finish at 19 under. Hideki Matsuyama (67) and Talor Gooch (68) tied for fourth at 16 under.
The scores were unusually low because recent rain had softened the greens, and there was very little wind coming off the Pacific Ocean.
“Twenty-one under par at Torrey Pines is great golf, ” Rose said, dedicating the win to his caddie, Mark Fulcher, who is hospitalized but doing well after having heart surgery last week. “This one’s for him.”
Scott said his closing surge was “too late” because Rose had built a four-shot lead and birdied two of the final four holes himself. Scott also blamed himself for missing two short putts on the front nine, one from 18 inches on No. 5.
“I think Justin performed like the No. 1 player should today,” Scott said. “When he was shaky, he bounced back nicely. He showed why he’s the No. 1 player in the world.”
Rose’s three-shot lead at the start of the day was trimmed to one after he made bogeys on Nos. 1, 4 and 5. But he played bogey-free the rest of the day while making five more birdies.
“I never lost the lead, so I had to stay patient,” Rose said. “I scratched a line on my scorecard after the sixth hole and said, ‘We build a round from this point on.’ ”
Scott moved to two shots behind with a tap-in birdie on the par-4 17th and needed an eagle on the 18th hole to force a playoff. But he hit his tee shot into a bunker left of the fairway and had to lay up. Both players made birdie on the final hole with short putts.
In his first event of the 2019 season, Tiger Woods was never a factor. His weeklong putting woes continued Sunday on his first nine, but he rediscovered his stroke with five birdies over his final eight holes to shoot 67, finishing in a tie for 20th at 10 under. He shot all four rounds under par at Torrey Pines for the first time since 2008, and it was his first sub-70 round here since 2013, the year of his most recent of seven titles in the event.
“It was nice to shake off some rust,” Woods said. “I think the whole week was good, very positive. I wasn’t as sharp as I wanted to be, but each and every day it got a little better. I was hitting my putts on my lines; I just wasn’t reading them right. I burned a lot of lips and made my share today, which was nice.”
Woods said his next event would be the Genesis Open at Riviera Country Club (Feb. 14-17), where his charitable foundation is the primary beneficiary.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — After 26 Masters appearances, it is hard to catch three-time champion Phil Mickelson off guard even with a revamped fifth hole that has been the talk of Augusta National this week.
Steely play may be in order at the redesigned Magnolia, where the tee has been moved back 40 yards, but Mickelson told reporters on Tuesday that he was taking it in his stride.
"I think 4, 5, 6, 7 is a very difficult four-hole stretch and making it a little bit harder I think is a good thing," Mickelson said. "I always like making hard holes harder."
Experience on the difficult greens is something Mickelson can rely on to help snag a Green Jacket for the fourth time, with his 100th career round at the Masters slated for Friday.
"There are always little subtleties and nuances that you have to relearn," he said.
"Every time I come out here and practise, I pick up a little something here or there that I did not know on how to play a certain shot from a certain position to a certain pin."
If he can secure victory, it will be by defying the odds. Mickelson, who will turn 49 in June, is roughly two and a half years older than the oldest Masters champion Jack Nicklaus, who claimed his sixth victory in 1986 at the age of 46.
Mickelson already has a career befitting one of the game's greats, having spent over 25 years on the PGA tour, with 195 top-10 finishes, 44 PGA championships and five major wins.
That does not mean he is looking to slow down anytime soon.
"There's no reason now with the knowledge we have in fitness, the knowledge we have in biomechanics, and the knowledge we have with nutrition and so forth, that we, at a much older age than in the past, should not be able to perform at a very high level," Mickelson said.
The only major to elude him has been the U.S. Open, in which he has either tied for or placed second on six times.
But after winning the Pebble Beach Pro-Am in February, it seems a career grand slam may still be in reach since this year's U.S. Open will be played on the same course.

ORLANDO, Fla. — After his Friday round at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, Rory McIlroy spent the afternoon at Walt Disney World riding the Tower of Terror amusement park ride. He was persuaded to take the excursion by his wife, Erica, who reminded him that he visited Disney’s parks last year and two days later produced an enchanted final round for a come-from-behind victory, his 14th on the PGA Tour.
For those who hitch their allegiances to McIlroy, following him can be a white-knuckle ride. McIlroy ranked first in the field in driving distance for the measured holes, 314 yards, and he played his way into the final Sunday pairing for the ninth time since January of last year — and for the third time in 2019. And for the ninth time since January of last year — and for the third time in 2019, McIlroy, a four-time major winner and a former world No. 1, could not close out a tournament from the last group.
Francesco Molinari, the reigning British Open champion from Italy, who began the final round at Bay Hill five strokes off the lead, carded an eight-under-par 64 to finish at 12-under, two better than the 54-hole leader, Matthew Fitzpatrick, who posted a 71.
McIlroy, who closed with a 64 on his way to last year’s title, shot 72 to finish in a four-way tie for sixth. It is his fifth top-six finish in five starts this calendar year, and also his 12th top-eight finish in his last 23 worldwide starts.
During his final-pairing run of close calls, McIlroy, 29, has lost to some of the top players, including Tiger Woods, Dustin Johnson, Justin Thomas, Patrick Reed and Molinari.
“I’m playing well,” McIlroy said. “I would much rather be putting myself in position to have a chance to win.”
That is the lottery-half-won way of looking at it. The other way to view it is that when the title has been within his grasp, McIlroy has not hit his approaches close enough or putted well. On Sunday, he played the par-5s in one-under.
“I just didn’t play the par-5s well enough,” McIlroy said, adding, “I was saying to Matt walking up 17 it’s like we’re hitting really good shots, but we’re leaving ourselves putts that we were sort of being defensive with because you don’t want to run it 6 feet by trying to hole them.”
Putting was not a problem for Molinari, who drained four birdie attempts of more than 17 feet, including a 21-footer at No. 1 and a 44-footer at No. 18.
“One of my best putting rounds ever,” said Molinari, who also coolly sank an 11-footer to save par at the second.
The first of Molinari’s three victories last season came at the BMW P.G.A. Championship at Wentworth, which was the third time in 2018 that McIlroy was in the final group. He began the fourth round tied with Molinari, who shot four under for a two-stroke victory over McIlroy. By the end of the summer, Molinari had added the Quicken Loans and British Open titles — and McIlroy had played his way into three more final-round pairings: at the World Golf Championships event in Ohio, the BMW Championship and the Tour Championship.
“When I won last year, playing with Rory,” Molinari said, “it wasn’t easy at all. So from there, I started building my confidence and just saying I could get it done.”
Molinari, 36, was grouped for the first two rounds with Brice Garnett and Ted Potter Jr., two golfers with zero major titles and three PGA Tour wins between them.
Despite his No. 10 world ranking and his star turn with Tommy Fleetwood for the European team at last year’s Ryder Cup, Molinari seemed easy to overlook on the leader board. Keith Mitchell, who consolidated his first tour title last week with a tie for sixth at Bay Hill, signed his scorecard for a closing 66 — and an eight-under total — while the leaders were on the front nine.
Asked what he thought the winning score would be, Mitchell guessed 10 or 11 under and said, unbidden, “I think Rory McIlroy’s obviously proven himself time in and time out” so that if he went lower, he added, “I wouldn’t even be surprised.”
McIlroy is determined not to let the results define him. “Yeah, my Sundays haven’t been what I would have liked,” he said, “but I’m putting myself in that position. Good golf is good golf.”

PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. — A few dozen spectators and three grazing deer surrounded the first tee at Monterey Peninsula Country Club on Thursday, craning their necks to get a better look at the players beginning the hole. The foursome included Aaron Rodgers, the Green Bay Packers quarterback who grew up five hours away in Chico, starred collegiately at California and was trailed all day by cries of “Go Bears” — which he acknowledged by saying, “Go Bears, but not Chicago.”
Rodgers, though, was not his group’s main attraction, and he was fine with that. In fact, he essentially signed up for a supporting role. Last month, heused his Twitter account to petitionto play the first three rounds of the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am with Choi Ho-sung, the 194th-ranked player in the world who was making his PGA Tour debut on a sponsor’s exemption.
Choi’s swing was known in the United States long before he arrived at Pebble Beach. It has become a viral sensation because Choi, a South Korean native and a regular of the Japan Tour, is a cross between Chi Chi Rodriguez and Fred Astaire.
Choi spins around on his follow-through as if his club is his dance partner. His pre-swing routine is also unique, resembling an oblique muscle stretch; he swivels to his left and his eyes lock on his left shoulder as he holds his club high, as if to light a kerosene street lamp. He pauses at the top long enough to exhale loudly, making a “shoo” sound before settling over his ball.
Jordan Spieth, the three-time major winner and the 2017 champion at Pebble Beach, had seen videos of Choi and was among those eager to see him up close.
“I actually was fascinated, clearly, by his swing, and the way he moves around,” Spieth said, adding: “It’s just really entertaining. I think people are really excited to see him this week.”
Choi, 45, did not take up the game until he was around the same age as the 25-year-old Spieth, but he has developed a showman’s touch. The bigger the crowd, the more he appears to play to it. Upon being introduced to warm applause on the first tee, Choi bowed to the fans on three sides of the tee box before settling into his pre-shot routine.
On a different tee, he took his driver head cover, decorated with studded stars, and pretended to give a back rub to Rodgers and Jerry Kelly, the other pro, by brushing it over their sweaters. Later, the other amateur, the actor Chris O’Donnell, was teasing Rodgers about his mustache, which called to mind Burt Reynolds’s facial hair in the 1970s film “Smokey and the Bandit.” Rodgers looked at Choi, who was standing nearby, and Choi gave him the thumbs up.
“See,” Rodgers said, “Ho-sung likes it.”
Choi surprised Rodgers with his English abilities, after Rodgers surprised Choi by greeting him in Korean. Kelly introduced himself to Choi on the practice green with an outstretched hand and a wide grin. “We will have so much fun!” he told him.
After the round, Choi broke into a broad smile of his own and said that Kelly had been right.
“I think my pairing was just as good as the weather,” Choi said through an interpreter, referring to the abundant sunshine and negligible breeze, “and I learned a lot from Jerry Kelly.”
Choi knows that he has a lot of catching up to do. He was training for a job in the fishing industry, he said, until he lost the tip of his right thumb in a chain saw accident at 23.
Doctors reattached the tip, and Choi redirected his focus, landing a part-time job at a golf course two years later. It was there that he honed his self-taught swing.
This is his first trip to the United States, he said, and he arrived with loads of enthusiasm but not a single endorsement. His black cap and turquoise sweater both featured the Pebble Beach Golf Links logo, and his caddie carried a new TaylorMade bag that seemed tailor-made for Choi, with a silhouette logo of his follow-through, complete with the kick flourish.
Choi said he chose his first-round outfit purposefully. “I wanted to show my appreciation for the tournament for having me out here,” he said, adding, “I’m incredibly grateful, and that’s why I’m wearing the logo.”
The group was led by Jonah Webster, a 16-year-old golfer from Sonora, Calif., roughly 170 miles northeast of Monterey Bay. His grandfather, Steve Lee, who walked alongside him Thursday, said Webster had trembled with excitement when he found out he would be carrying the scoring sign for Rodgers, one of his idols, and Choi, whose swing he had watched on YouTube.
Lee joked that he had told his grandson to close his eyes when Choi took the club away, because his swing was not exactly something that impressionable youngsters should be trying. “It’s fun to pull for a guy who’s so unique,” Lee said.
Outside the ropes, others seemed to share Lee’s sentiment. They cheered for every good shot and great escape orchestrated by Choi, who was four over after 10 holes but made three birdies in the final eight to salvage a one-over 72. At the end of the second round on Friday, he was tied for 128th place at four over.
“I definitely felt the love from my fans,” Choi said, “and I felt like that pushed me more to focus on the back nine.”
Choi’s struggles notwithstanding, he at least impressed Rodgers. “He’s not a sideshow,” the quarterback said. “He can play, and I think it’s really good for golf.”

AUGUSTA, Ga. — The fifth hole at Augusta National is certainly not the most famous, but this year it could be the hardest after being stretched so far that they had to reroute the road that ran behind the old tee.
The par-four has been turned into a brute, lengthened some 40 yards to nearly 500 yards, officially 495 though the number will change slightly each day depending on where the pin is put.
The tees will also likely be moved a few yards each day.
"I think number five is probably going to play the toughest hole now for sure," said world number one Justin Rose.
The hole, which curves gently to the left without being a dogleg, still has two deep bunkers guarding the left-hand side, encouraging players to aim more for the right side of the fairway.
Rory McIlroy, perhaps the longest hitter in the field, used to worry about his ball running through the fairway and into bushes on the right, and often used a three-wood off the tee for safety instead of a driver.
Now he can swing away without fear.
"I think (hole) five has been a very good change in terms (that) it puts driver back in a lot of guys' hands that wouldn't necessarily hit driver on that hole," said the Northern Irishman.
"And you need to hit driver; because I came here last Wednesday, played in the morning, it was a little cold, a little damp and I hit four-iron into the green.
"If you hit three-wood and you're 30 yards back of (where driver would stop) you're on the upslope and you can hardly see the green."
Tiger Woods succinctly summed up the new hole.
"It's just long," he said on Wednesday. "The bunkers are still deep. I think they are unplayable to get the ball to the green."
The hole was parred more than two-thirds of the time in 2018, when it yielded only 26 birdies all week, along with 64 bogeys and four double-bogeys.
It was the sixth hardest of the week.
It is likely to give up even fewer birdies this week, but a lot more bogeys.
"I always like making hard holes harder," said three-times Masters champion Phil Mickelson.
For the shorter hitters, the game plan has not really changed.
"The tee shot is pretty much the same shot," said British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who is not a particularly long hitter.
"The second shot, obviously is longer, considerably longer. Yesterday it was playing into the wind, and probably with the old tee we would have been hitting seven-iron in, and we were hitting four-iron in yesterday.
"I think that's going to be around a three-club difference."

(Reuters) - Malaysian golfer Arie Irawan died of "apparent natural causes" on Sunday in his hotel room on the Chinese resort island of Hainan, the PGA tour said in a statement. He was 28.
Arie, who turned professional in 2013 and won two events on the Asian Development Tour in 2015, had missed the halfway cut at the Sanya Championship, the second event on the PGA Tour China Series.
"The PGA Tour and the China Golf Association grieve at this loss of one of our members and share sincere condolences with Arie's wife, Marina, and his parents, Ahmad and Jeny," the PGA tour statement added.
"When something of this magnitude occurs in the golf world, we all grieve at the same time.
"Out of respect for the family, officials cancelled the final round of the Sanya Championship, the tournament becoming a 54-hole event."
The coroner's report had not been completed, the statement said.
Trevor Sluman, who shot a third-round six-under 66 to take a two-shot lead on Saturday, was declared the champion and his victory will count as an official PGA TOUR Series-China win.
The American offered his condolences after he learned of the round's cancellation.
"My heart goes out to Arie's family and his beautiful wife, Marina," Sluman said.
"Along with the rest of the Tour, we're thinking about them at this time. It's very bittersweet today, and I think the rest of the year will be dedicated to Arie and the impact he had on this Tour."
Arie's golf career was interrupted in 2016 when he was involved in an accident on a moped and sidelined for several months. He was ranked 1,366th in the world this week.
He married Marina Malek last May and she sometimes worked as his caddie, even if Arie admitted that she did not know much about golf.
"If I make a bad score she will say 'it is okay, it is okay'," he told Malaysia's The Star newspaper last year.
"She keeps me calm, relaxed and happy so I just go out there and play golf. That helps me a lot. She has always been there for me through the bad and good times."

Tiger Woods on Monday withdrew from this week’s Arnold Palmer Invitational because of a neck strain. While Woods played down the injury, any fresh health setback to the game’s most popular player has often elicited alarm throughout the golf community.
Recognizing that level of concern, and aware that a series of lower back surgeries nearly ended his career, Woods tried to mitigate the expected reaction to his exit from the Palmer event, which he has won eight times.
“My lower back is fine, and I have no long-term concerns,” Woodswrote on his Twitter account.
1) Unfortunately due to a neck strain that I’ve had for a few weeks, I'm forced to withdraw from the API. I’ve been receiving treatment, but it hasn't improved enough to play. My lower back is fine, and I have no long-term concerns, and I hope to be ready for The Players.
Woods, 43, indicated he has been bothered by the neck strain for “a few weeks,” and added: “I’ve been receiving treatment, but it hasn’t improved enough to play.”
Woods’s neck issue may indeed be minor, but for many years when he struggled to play through myriad infirmities, Woods often withdrew from a tournament with a similarly short statement about a seemingly insignificant injury. In the end, he missed dozens of events, and his absences from competition lasted months because of multiple, serious knee operations and four back surgeries.
On Monday, Woods did offer one encouraging sentence: “I hope to be ready for The Players.”
The Players Championship, which is the PGA Tour’s flagship event and is often called a fifth major golf championship, runs from March 14 to 17. Woods’s optimism about playing in the tournament will help calm worries about his golf fitness for now.
But should he miss that tournament, a fair amount of panic will probably ensue about his ability to continue a startling comeback that was one of the most uplifting stories in sports last year. The Masters begins in five weeks, on April 11.
Six months ago, Woods completed an unforeseen return to golf’s upper echelon and ended a five-year winless drought, with a victory at the season-ending Tour Championship. It was the 18th tournament that Woods played in 2018 — his first full schedule of events since 2015. He did not miss a tournament he was scheduled to appear at last year.
This year, Woods has already played three times. Eight days ago, he finished tied for 10th at the Mexico Championship. At that event, Woods did not mention any neck discomfort, and he did not say Monday how the injury occurred. In his two other events this year, Woods tied for 20th at the Farmer Insurance Open at Torrey Pines in late January, and he shared 15th place at the Genesis Open at Riviera in mid-February.
Woods last won the Arnold Palmer Invitational in 2013, although he made a charge up the leaderboard at the event last year before stumbling in the final holes to finish in a tie for fifth place.
“I’d like to send my regrets to the Palmer family and the Orlando fans,” Woods wrote on Twitter on Monday. “Its connection to Arnold makes it one of my favorite tournaments and I’m disappointed to miss it.”
Woods, who has won 80 PGA Tour events and 14 major championships, has elevated his world golf ranking to 12th. That ranking had slipped as low as 1,199th while he battled various leg and back injuries.

(Reuters) - A jubilant Kim Si-woo aced the 16th hole to push his lead to four strokes after the second round of the Texas Open at San Antonio on Friday.
A group of six players, including headliners Jordan Spieth and Rickie Fowler, were left in second place after the overnight leader's hole-in-one.
Kim, who started the day with a one-stroke advantage, drove a nine iron to the green at the 167-yard par-three then watched the ball bounce into the hole.
The South Korean world number 61 tossed his club aside and thrust both arms into the air in celebration at his second career hole-in-one on the PGA Tour.
"I saw the bounce, but I never see it go in," said the 23-year-old, who estimated he has made six or seven holes-in-one in all.
Kim, aiming for his third PGA Tour victory, ended the round at 12-under 132 thanks to four birdies and the ace in his second consecutive 66.
"I saw the solo lead last four holes [and I said] I can make birdie, just trying to go aggressive," said Kim.
His previous PGA wins came at the Wyndham in 2016 and the Players Championship in 2017.
Spieth and Fowler, who both shot 68 for the second round in a row, shared second with fellow Americans Harold Varner (66) and Adam Schenk (66) as well as Canadian Corey Conners (67) and Kim's compatriot Lee Kyoung-hoon (67).
MASTERS TUNE-UP
Fowler at one point led Kim on nine-under for the tournament but back-to-back bogeys at the 15th and 16th were costly.
The 2018 Masters runner-up had been rolling along with four birdies and an eagle at the par four fifth hole against one bogey before the let down.
The eagle came after Fowler's drive had carried 328 yards to within four feet of the hole. He collected a fifth birdie at the 17th to ease his displeasure.
"I'm happy with it," Fowler said of the round. "Hit some good shots out there, made a few putts. Yeah, 15, 16, kind of a little unforced errors."
The wind was a factor in both bogeys, he said.
Former Masters champion Spieth, along with Fowler among only a handful of big names using the Texas Open to tune up for Augusta next week, also had an eagle. His came at the par-five eighth, his 17th hole of the day.
After two bogeys sandwiching a birdie in his first three holes, the Texan rebounded for four more birdies and the eagle to go with another bogey.
"I had more control with my long clubs today," Spieth said. "Still didn't hit many fairways, but it felt better, if that makes sense.
"So normally the better results come from the club starting to feel more in control. So I'll just do a little bit of light work this afternoon and go into the weekend with a chance to win."

By Manny Fernandez in Donna, Tex.
It’s springtime on the border, and that means the winter season is winding down — the months when tens of thousands of retirees from Minnesota, South Dakota, Illinois and other parts of the Midwest adopt South Texas as their home away from home.
Retirees in swimsuits ride their bicycles to the pool, bright noodles tucked under their arms like jousting lances. They line the streets for golf-cart parades. They venture into Mexico, shopping for cheap medicine, getting pedicures, undergoing low-cost dental work and sipping goblet-sized margaritas.
They are known as Winter Texans, and they concentrate mainly in the Rio Grande Valley, the temperate region deep in South Texas that is also the place where the largest number of migrants has been crossing lately from Central America — President Trump has declared a national emergency along the border and stationed Army troops to help control the escalating influx. One of their base camps was a quarter-mile from where seniors at the Victoria Palms resort in Donna deploy by the dozens to occupy five pickleball courts.
The annual invasion of Midwesterners — and a number of Canadians — has decreased in recent years, but they remain an economic and cultural force. An estimated 106,000 Winter Texans spent about $528 million in the valley in the 2017-18 winter season, according to a survey by the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. Tex-Mex restaurants fly welcome banners for them. There are Winter Texan newspapers, age-qualified RV parks, expos, cruises, theater productions and bumper stickers — one pickup truck in the border city of McAllen had two: “Iowa Winter Texan” and “I’m retired. Go around.”
“It gets me out of the snowbanks,” said Dean Miller, 58, a resident of Detroit Lakes, Minn., who spends the winter living and working at the Winter Ranch resort in Alamo. “You’ll go to some event down here and you’ll find your neighbor from back home.”
The majority of Winter Texans are white and in their early 70s. Many of them voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, and their very presence this winter quietly subverted the president’s assertion that the border is in crisis. They have been coming to the region for years — in some cases, their parents were Winter Texans, too — and the political dynamics and national-emergency rhetoric has no effect on how, or where, they spend their retirement.
“We don’t see what you see on TV,” said Terry Goss, the general manager of Victoria Palms, one of the largest Winter Texan communities, with up to 2,500 retirees.
What do Winter Texans see, exactly?
A slice of border life that looks nothing like what many Americans think of as border life. There was Nathan’s fourth annual Sock Hop at Ranchero Village in Weslaco one Friday. There were fish frys and riverboat tours, line dancing and karaoke sessions, bluegrass acoustic jams and nondenominational church services. At the Winter Ranch resort in Alamo one Monday afternoon, the Winter Ranch Players packed the house with three one-act plays, “The Ethel and Albert Comedies.” At Victoria Palms, Mr. Goss spoke standing next to a poster listing all the sold-out shows at the resort’s ballroom, one of them a Rolling Stones tribute band concert. Victoria Palms is so popular with Canadians that a Victoria Palms reunion is scheduled most summers near Toronto.
Margaret Hitzemann, 63, who normally lives in Onamia, Minn., spent the past two months in a townhouse in Port Aransas, near Corpus Christi. One rainy afternoon, she and her husband visited the Mexican tourist town of Nuevo Progreso. They bought crispy chapulines — crickets, a fried delicacy — and went into a pharmacy to buy some cheap medicine.
“We don’t take a lot of meds, so we were thinking, ‘Oh, let’s go down and get some cheap Tylenol and Advil and that kind of thing,’” Ms. Hitzemann said. “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, this isn’t any cheaper than Walmart.’ So we ended up not buying any medications.”
In a region with a large Latino population and tolerant attitudes toward immigration — many people have family members on both sides of the border — culture clash with the Northerners is inevitable. The study released by the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley included unedited messages from Winter Texans to local officials, and some of the sharpest comments read: “Be more American, less Mexican. This is not Mexico!” and “Have channel 5 respect Mr. Trump” and “Keep the grass cut, the trash picked up and speak English.”
Already, the exodus back north has started. The end of the season for many comes on Thursday, with the annual Winter Texan appreciation day in Nuevo Progreso.
For some, the season never ends. There are Converted Texans, former Winter Texans who settle in the valley for good. Kristi Collier, a McAllen native who runs a media and hospitality company that caters to Winter Texans called Welcome Home, Rio Grande Valley, hosts an annual Converted Texan Fiesta in April. (She leads a swearing-in ceremony.)
Among the ranks of the converted are Ken and Lois Lane, originally from Anchorage, who started spending winters at Victoria Palms in 2005. They now live there permanently in a double-wide mobile home.
“I think the cost of living here is very reasonable, compared to many other places,” said Mr. Lane, 73, a retired power dispatcher for an electrical company.
He and his wife visited Nuevo Progreso and hosted their son and his family from Iowa over spring break. The couple is in a unique category: sort of reverse Winter Texans.
“The motor home we kept and in the summer when it gets real hot, we go up north,” Mr. Lane said.

“There are people out there who just say, ‘Send them all back and build a wall.’ But they would be facing empty shelves in the grocery store if that were to happen.”
— Mike McMahon, a dairy farmer in upstate New York.
The farms of upstate New York are thousands of miles from the southern border, but close enough to the northern one that the Border Patrol has jurisdiction. Farmers’ reliance on undocumented workers had made the region a focal point in the debate over the Trump administration’s border policies, leading to tensions between state politicians of both parties and the federal agents enforcing the president’s crackdown on illegal immigration.
Christina Goldbaum, an immigration reporter in The New York Times’s Metro department, explored Mr. McMahon’s story, and those of migrants who work at farms like his, in an article this week.Read more about it here.
This week, KPBS, a public radio station in Southern California, launched a new podcast, “Only Here,” about life and culture in San Diego and Tijuana — “the art, food, traditions and culture that exists because of the border,” they write. The first episode profiles a young photographer who is gay and undocumented,and you can listen to it, along with other episodes, here.
Podcast creators, like everyone else, have been drawn to stories and conversations about the border. If you prefer your stories in audio form, here are a few more to get you started:
• “The Green Line,” produced by the union of Border Patrol agents. The hosts, Art Del Cueto and Brandon Judd, are Border Patrol agents who have been supportive of President Trump’s policies — and bothappeared at his sidein the White House briefing room in January when he talked about declaring a national emergency to help build a border wall. (The Times has written about them before.)
• Last spring, WNYC’s Radiolab ran “Border Project,” a three-part series about a Border Patrol policy that most likely led to a rise, beginning in the late 1990s, in the number of migrants who died while crossing to the United States. It also profiles some of the migrants who made the trek despite it.Listen to all the episodes here.
• This episode of PRX’s Radio Diaries, “The Border Wall,” focuses on those strange parts of the border that one woman calls a “no-man’s land,” cut off from their country by a barrier that doesn’t always follow the line it’s meant to.
• Our very own “Daily” podcast has many great episodes from the border. Start with a two-part series, “Dispatches From the Border” (Part 1 hereandPart 2 here), which follows Azam Ahmed, the Times bureau chief for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, and other Times journalists on a trip along the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico. Then there’s this episode, “The Scars of Family Separation,” about a migrant father who crossed the border with his daughter. Finally, from last summer, “How Separating Migrant Families Became U.S. Policy” is an interview with Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser who has helped the president frame his immigration policy.

The studios at Fox News, CNN and MSNBC filled with anchors and commentators, waiting for Attorney General William P. Barr to make news on Sunday afternoon with the release of a letter summarizing the findings of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.
As the cable teams assembled, NBC News prepared to interrupt a golf tournament and ABC News got ready to break into coverage of a professional video-game contest.
NBC was the first broadcast network to provide details of Mr. Barr’s four-page summary of Mr. Mueller’s far lengthier and still unpublished report. The network’s justice correspondent, Pete Williams, stood before the Justice Department headquarters in Washington and simply read aloud from the attorney general’s letter to Congress.
After he was through, Kate Snow, the NBC anchor on duty, said, “Some of what you just read cold on the air is a lot of legalese.”
Mr. Williams scanned the document and found a key sentence about Russia’s attempt at meddling in the 2016 presidential election: “‘The special counsel did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts,’” Mr. Williams said, reading aloud.
He also said that, while the report apparently did not conclude that President Trump had committed a crime, it also did not exonerate him.
On CNN at roughly the same time, three correspondents, who were seated side by side (by side) in the network’s Washington studio, stared at their phone screens and called out important phrases from the Barr letter.
Their well-meaning efforts were interrupted by the anchor Wolf Blitzer, who read aloud atweetthat had been posted by Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York: “‘The Special Counsel states that ‘while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,”’” Mr. Blitzer said.
Mr. Blitzer ceded the stage to Jeffrey Toobin, the CNN legal analyst, who said that, in his view, Mr. Mueller’s report amounted to “total vindication of the president and his staff on the issue of collusion.”
After a fanfare of timpani drums, George Stephanopoulos of ABC broke into that network’s broadcast of a professional video-game contest at 3:42, a few minutes after NBC had aired its live reading of the news-making letter.
The matter of Mr. Mueller’s elusiveness came up during the ABC special report. “We never heard from the man in 22 months,” Mr. Stephanopoulos said of the special counsel.
Pierre Thomas, the senior justice correspondent for ABC, nodded in agreement and recalled being told that “Robert Mueller would be the president’s best friend, if he found no evidence of collusion.”
CBS waited until 3:51 to cut into its coverage of the annual men’s college basketball tournament with a 90-second report by Paula Reid, a correspondent covering the Justice Department and the White House.
When a full gamut of panelists appeared on CBS, they were not news reporters, but sports commentators, and they were offering halftime analysis. “It feels like it should be more than an 8-point lead for Carolina,” Greg Gumbel said of a game between the University of Washington and the University of North Carolina. (CBS followed the game commentary with a second report from Ms. Reid and its chief White House correspondent, Major Garrett, also during halftime.)
Hours before Mr. Barr had provided his rundown of the much-anticipated report — which Mr. Mueller had assembled in seemingly leakproof silence over a 22-month period — it was the main fodder for the politically oriented Sunday morning shows and early-afternoon cable news programs.
Chuck Todd led a wall-to-wall discussion on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” It included commentary on whether the Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke had jumped the gun at a campaign stop on Friday when he said: “This is an unprecedented attack on this country and on our democracy, and we are owed the facts. And if we do not receive them, 243 years in, there’s nothing that guarantees us a 244th.”
On “Fox News Sunday,” the program hosted by Chris Wallace, Representative Doug Collins, Republican of Georgia, said the president had been proved right in repeatedly saying “no collusion.” On the same show, Mr. Nadler called for the release of the entire report and its underlying materials.
Also in the morning hours, on CNN’s “Reliable Sources,” the host Brian Stelter asked of whether reporters and talking heads had inflated expectations.
He seemed to be reacting toan analytical article posted onlineon Saturday by the Rolling Stone journalist Matt Taibbi, who wrote that the lack of new charges emerging from the report “is a deathblow for the reputation of the American news media.” Mr. Taibbi cited instances of overreaching by some reporters and pundits to make his case.
Mr. Stelter pushed back against that view. “Don’t be fooled by the partisans who cherry-pick the worst mistakes of individual journalists or the craziest ideas from commentators and claim that’s the entire media,” he said.
The problem, Mr. Stelter said, lay in the competing interests of “agenda-driven columnists” and “journalists who report the news.” He put Joy-Ann Reid, of MSNBC, and Jesse Watters, of Fox News, in the agenda-driven camp. Then he rolled a clip of Ms. Reid suggesting that Mr. Barr may have an interest in covering up the facts; and another of Mr. Watters characterizing the Mueller report as “a knockout blow to the Democrats and the press who say, ‘Collusion, collusion, collusion.’”
The Nixon-era reporting led by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of The Washington Post seemed newly exceptional, now that Mr. Mueller’s work was done. Mr. Bernstein, a CNN contributor who was a guest on Mr. Stelter’s show, praised recent coverage of President Trump and the allegations that have surrounded him. He singled out the journalism of The Wall Street Journal — owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation — as a sign that democracy was working.
Noting its assiduously reported articles on Mr. Trump, Mr. Bernstein said, “It ought to be stressed that the same owner of Fox News published these stories in his paper.”

Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV,sign up for our Watching newsletterand get recommendations straight to your inbox.
On Day 26 of the partial government shutdown, Jimmy Kimmel said he might have figured out a way to convince President Trump to abandon his course. He noticed that Trump hadn’t played golf since before the shutdown began. (Helast playedon Nov. 25, the longest spell without a golf game in his presidency.)
Kimmel presumes that Trump knows it would look bad for him to be out on the course instead of negotiating with Democrats to reopen the government.
“I know it doesn’t mean much to Donald Trump that a bunch of Americans are being forced to work without paychecks,” Kimmel said. “But I know what does matter to you. I know what you care about down to the bottom of your Kentucky-fried little heart. And that is golf.”
Kimmel suggested to the president that he give up on funding a border wall and simply reopen the government so he can hit the links again.
“With one crazy zigzag stroke of your executive Sharpie, you could be back on the greens at Mar-a-Lago, faster than you can say ‘Pocahontas.’ You’ll be right back out there eating club sandwiches and bossing caddies around with the boys. It’s a win-win, for us and for you. The federal employees can go back to work, you can get back to doing what you do best: cheating at golf. It’s good for you, and it’s good for America. We need you out on the golf course as much as possible — to keep from you doing things! So think about it. Let’s play our way out of the rough together.” —JIMMY KIMMEL
Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, asked Trump on Wednesday to either delay or cancel his State of the Union address amid the shutdown. She suggested that he could submit his remarks in writing, rather than delivering them to Congress. Both Stephen Colbert and James Corden saw a problem with that idea.
“Now, pointing out that until Woodrow Wilson was president, presidents didn’t give the State of the Union in person, Pelosi gave Trump the option to deliver it in writing. Really? In writing? Have you seen how this guy spells? He’s just going to tweet, ‘The Stat of our Uniom is … STRANG!’” —STEPHEN COLBERT
“Pelosi did say Trump can submit a written version of his speech, which is pretty strategic on her part. She’s going right for his biggest handicap: spelling.” —JAMES CORDEN
Chris Christie announced that he would release a memoir about his experiences in Trump’s inner circle. The title is “Let Me Finish: Trump, the Kushners, Bannon, New Jersey and the Power of In-Your-Face Politics.” Colbert and Seth Meyers both had some fun with that.
“Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie is releasing a memoir later this month titled ‘Let Me Finish.’ Oh, you haven’t seen your approval ratings lately? You’re finished.” —SETH MEYERS
“His book chronicles his time in Trump’s inner circle, and it’s called ‘Let Me Finish.’ And how dare you suggest that the original title was ‘Are You Gonna Finish That?’ Shame on you! Shame on you for thinking that!’” —STEPHEN COLBERT
“Netflix just announced they will be raising subscription prices by up to $2 a month. Yeah, I know, this is awful news for the person whose account you use.” —JAMES CORDEN
“The federal government has been closed for 26 days, and experts say the shutdown could cause the economy to shrink. Then the president said, ‘No, it’s only shrinking cause it’s cold outside.’” —JIMMY FALLON
“The C.E.O. of Delta said the shutdown has already cost the airline $25 million. He’s not that worried, because they’ll make it all back if two people pay to check their bags.” —JIMMY FALLON
Baker Mayfield of the Cleveland Browns is a sensational young quarterback. But surely you’ve been wondering whether he’s also good at identifying objects by nuzzling them. Fear not, here’s your chance to find out.
Jimmy Fallon is known for playing games on his show. But they’re not usually like this.
Roy Wood Jr., a correspondent on “The Daily Show,” will decamp to Fallon’s show, where he’ll be a guest on Thursday.

LOS ANGELES — Matt Kuchar had heard enough. Battered by criticism that he had essentially stiffed a caddie who helped him win a tournament last November in Mexico, he took action to make amends on Friday, issuing a statement in which he apologized for his initial actions and also said he had now paid the caddie a good deal more money.
In the 15-line statement, which was released while he was playing the rain-delayed first and second rounds of the Genesis Open in Los Angeles, Kuchar said he had now given the caddie, David Giral Ortiz, a much bigger sum than the $5,000 he originally paid him after capturing the first-place prize of $1.296 million at the Mayakoba Golf Classic.
In issuing the statement, Kuchar clearly hoped to put an end to the bad tidings that had sullied his image and cast him as a tone-deaf American with a let-them-eat-cake attitude.
“Golf is a game where we call penalties on ourselves,” Kuchar said in the statement. “I should have done that long ago and not let this situation escalate.”
The statement did not specify how much more Kuchar had sent Ortiz’s way, but it appears an additional $45,000 was paid out.
Ortiz had been asking for a total of $50,000, according to Marc Graubart, a Houston businessman working on the caddie’s behalf, and Kuchar, in his statement, said Ortiz had now been paid what he was seeking.
Kuchar’s apology came at the end of a trying week for him, and after a challenging first round on Friday at the Riviera Country Club, where he heard the usual genial chants of “Kooooch” from some of his fans but also a number of barbs from others about his perceived parsimony.
Kuchar, 40, has earned more than $45 million as a professional golfer, but his problems began when he won a tournament in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, that he had basically entered on a whim.
In a typical PGA Tour arrangement, a caddie receives a flat rate of $1,500 for a tournament, which helps cover expenses, and a bonus worth 10 percent of the golfer’s winnings. For Ortiz, a local caddie who is also known as El Tucan, that would have amounted to about $130,000.
Instead, Ortiztold Michael Bamberger of Golf.com, he and Kuchar had agreed on a $3,000 payment plus an unspecified amount of whatever money Kuchar won at the tournament.
Kuchar, meanwhile, said he had promised Ortiz $1,000 if he missed the cut, $2,000 if he made the cut, $3,000 for a top-20 finish and $4,000 for a top-10 finish, with no specifications for how much more he would pay Ortiz if he finished first.
Which Kuchar proceeded to do, ending a four-year winless drought. At that point, Kuchar gave Ortiz $5,000 — the $4,000 he said they had agreed upon for the top-10 finish and a $1,000 bonus. Kuchar confirmed that total to Golf.com and added, “For a guy who makes $200 a day, a $5,000 week is a really big week.”
But the tone and content of that comment were quickly pounced on, particularly by people from outside the insular world of golf. And some golf fans weren’t too pleased by Kuchar’s attitude, either. As Kuchar walked down the first fairway on Friday morning, one fan stopped walking and shouted in Kuchar’s direction. “Frugal, just frugal,’’ the fan yelled. “I pay my caddie more.”
The fan, Brent Weiss, who described himself as a kindergarten teacher, said Kuchar had been his favorite player. But not anymore.
“How do you tip a caddie $1,000 when you’ve made $1.3 million?” Weiss said. “To me, I think that’s called discrimination.”
Weiss added, “I can’t even look at the guy.”
Not surprisingly, Kuchar also found himself the target of increasing indignation on social media.
In his statement on Friday, Kuchar, who is considered one of the more affable players on the tour, said he viewed his initial comments in defense of the $5,000 payment as “out of touch and insensitive.”
“They made it seem like I was marginalizing David Ortiz and his financial situation, which was not my intention,’’ the statement added. “I read them again and cringed. That is not who I am and not what I want to represent.”
Kuchar declined to comment as he walked off the course on Friday. When play was halted for the day, he still had five holes to complete in the second round.
A nine-time Tour winner, Kuchar serves as a brand spokesman for several companies, including Skechers shoes, Bridgestone Golf and Royal Bank of Canada. Before turning professional in 2000, Kuchar, who had starred at Georgia Tech, worked for a year as an investment banker.
Ortiz, a father of two, lives in a rented house and takes the bus to his job at the golf course. And the fact that he was paid only $5,000 by Kuchar might not have become as widely known as it did were it not for the efforts of Graubart, who regularly employs Ortiz during golf vacations in Mexico.
In a telephone interview on Thursday, Graubart said he happened to be with Ortiz in Mexico last month when questions about how much Kuchar had paid him surfaced. They saw Kuchar on television during a tournament in Hawaii, telling reporters that he had paid Ortiz more than $3,000 for his services but less than 10 percent of his total earnings.
Graubart said he then quizzed Ortiz about the details of his unwritten agreement with Kuchar. At which point, Graubart said, he explained the typical pay scale to Ortiz, who seemed unaware that he could have earned more money.
Graubart said he and a friend helped Ortiz write emails to Kuchar’s agent, Mark Steinberg, requesting more compensation. In a Jan. 23 email, which The New York Times obtained, Ortiz wrote that he had asked Kuchar for a percentage of his first-place check if he were to win. The existence of the emails was first reported by Golf.com.
“Matt said ‘sure’ with a smile,” Ortiz wrote in the email, “not believing that he would actually win the tournament.”
A few days later, Graubart said, Ortiz received an offer of $20,000 from a tournament director who appeared to be acting on behalf of Kuchar’s agent. But Graubart said Ortiz had requested $50,000, and the caddie then wrote an email asking if he could deal directly with Steinberg, who replied: “I am out of the country. What Matt has offered is fair.”
Some golf fans clearly disagreed. A GoFundMe account had been set up on Ortiz’s behalf and late on Thursday night, the total had reached $2,226.
But Kuchar had a significant change of heart, and now Ortiz has a lot more than that in his bank account.

Matt Kuchar shot a bogey-free six-under-par 66 to extend his lead in the Sony Open on Saturday at Waialae Country Club in Honolulu.
He’ll go into Sunday’s final round at 18-under 192 with a two-shot edge over Andrew Putnam, whose strong start allowed him to tie for the lead early in the third round.
The 40-year-old Kuchar was three-under on the front side and regained the top spot. He ended the round with six consecutive pars.
Kuchar will aim for his second championship in about two months after winning the Mayakoba Golf Classic in November in Mexico.
Kuchar opened with consecutive rounds of 63 this week. He excelled with the irons again Saturday, leaving himself birdie putts of reasonable length.
Putnam pulled even with Kuchar with three birdies in the first five holes. He had a shot for another birdie on No. 6, but his chip from the fringe sat just outside the cup. That would have made for birdies on three consecutive holes.
Keith Mitchell and Chez Reavie share third place at 14-under. Mitchell played a bogey-free round of 63, including four straight birdies on Nos. 7-10.
Reavie (66), who had three eagles Friday, was five-under through nine holes of Saturday’s round. Then he went through a three-over stretch from Nos. 11-13 before regrouping for two birdies the rest of the way.
Bryson DeChambeau made a move with 63, tying his best score on the PGA Tour. He opened the round with birdies on each of the first three holes.
He’s among a cluster of golfers at 11-under.
Corey Conners, Davis Love III, Charles Howell III, Dominic Bozzelli and Brian Stuard will all begin the final round tied at 11-under. They all checked in with 64s.
Hudson Swafford (67), Ted Potter Jr. (68) and Marc Leishman (68) are also in the bunch at 11-under.

(Reuters) - Ko Jin-young joined the long list of South Korean LPGA major champions on Sunday with a three-shot victory over compatriot Lee Mi-hyang at the ANA Inspiration in Rancho Mirage, California.
Ko, last year's Rookie of the Year, overcame a late wobble in the final round to became the fifth Korean to win the event after Grace Park (2004), Yoo Sun-young (2012), Park In-bee (2013) and Ryu So-yeon (2017).
She is the 15th woman from South Korea to win a major, the most of any country other than the United States, and the victory is projected to see her top the world rankings.
"I had a great round and a great week. I felt nervous today but I just tried to keep myself calm," said Ko.
After her lead had been reduced to one shot with three holes to play following two quick bogeys Ko responded like a true champion, a perfectly-judged 10-foot birdie putt at the 16th proving the decisive blow at Mission Hills .
She clinched in style with another birdie at the last for a two-under-par 70, bursting into tears when the putt fell.
"My caddie told me on the 18th that I had a two-shot lead and to not worry, just enjoy it," Ko said.
"So many Korean players had a great tournament, and it's a real honor for me to win."
Ko finished at 10-under 278, while Lee carded 70 for second place on seven-under, a shot ahead of American Lexi Thompson (67).
Kim In-kyung, who started the day in second place, fell out of contention with a double-bogey at the 11th, where her ball got stuck up a tree, forcing her to take a penalty stroke.
She shot 74 and tied for fourth with Spaniard Carlota Ciganda, five shots behind Ko.
The 23-year-old Ko said she had been dreaming of winning the event for five years and had always wanted to make the traditional winner's jump into Poppie's Pond.
"I always think about when I can go in that pond," she said. "That's today."
Despite the distractions and pressure of leading a major on a Sunday, Ko said she got over the line by trusting her swing.
"I just focused on my swing, on the putting, that's why I win this week," she said.
"I won. I can believe it now."

(Reuters) - Ko Jin-young surged from behind to earn a one-stroke lead over Kim In-kyung that could have been higher were it not for some late trouble in the third round of the ANA Inspiration in California on Saturday.
The 23-year-old carded a four-under-par 68 on the difficult Mission Hills course in Rancho Mirage to reel in overnight leader Kim in the first women's major of the season.
Even a double-bogey at the par-three 14th could not dent Ko's positive outlook after she posted an eight-under 208 total with one round remaining.
"I had a great round still," she smiled.
While Ko played a great front nine and an average back nine, it was the opposite for Kim, whose four-shot lead starting the day turned into a four-stroke deficit at the turn.
Kim steadied after her double-bogey at the ninth to shoot a 73, however, playing a bogey-free back nine and finishing in style by sinking a six-foot birdie at the last that left her nipping at the heels of her fellow South Korean.
The 18th is the same hole where Kim missed a one-foot putt in the final round that cost her victory in 2012 in one of the most dramatic moments in major history.
"I played quite well on the back nine. I'm surprised I'm still close to the lead," said Kim, who eventually put her disappointment behind her to win a different major, the 2017 Women's British Open.
Another Korean, Lee Mi-hyang (68), was boosted by a hole-in-one from 181 yards at the 17th and jumped into a share of third with American Danielle Kang (70), three shots from the lead.
Ko reeled off six birdies in her first 10 holes and surged to a four-stroke lead until disaster struck at the 14th.
The 124-yard hole required no more than a flick with a wedge, but she struck the ball a little heavy and it failed to clear the pond guarding the green.
Ko dropped two shots and gave renewed hope to her pursuers, who had been watching helplessly in the proverbial rear-view mirror as the Korean threatened to run away with it.
But world number five Ko, imbued with self-belief on the back of recent hot form that has taken her to the top of the LPGA money list, displayed composure beyond her years to keep a positive attitude.
"I'm not robot," she said. "I'm human. I don't think about bad things.
"This course is really hard, so anybody can miss a shot."

AUSTIN, Tex. — Rory McIlroy never trailed in his first three matches at Austin Country Club, advancing to the round of 16 at the World Golf Championships match-play event without having to play the 17th or 18th holes. He was looking to extend his front-running ways in an elimination match against Tiger Woods, whose superlative career has been a sucker pin that McIlroy recently decided to stop taking dogged aim at.
McIlroy, 29, has 15 PGA Tour titles, including four majors, which makes him the leader of the men’s 20-something set but far behind a pre-30-year-old Woods’s pace of 46 PGA Tour titles, including 10 majors.
McIlroy came into this week as perhaps the hottest player in the men’s game, with six top-six finishes in his first six starts in 2019, including a victory at the Players Championship. But unlike Woods, whose stated goal when he was McIlroy’s age was to win every time he played, McIlroy spoke earlier in the week of the likelihood that he would fail since he wins less than 10 percent of his starts. With odds like that, McIlroy has learned to measure success in other ways, like framing the struggles as growth opportunities and accentuating the positives.
McIlroy had never faced Woods, 43, in match play, and he clearly had no idea how quickly the conditions could change from warm to chilly. There was the rain and wind that blew in on the back nine, which was forecast. But McIlroy ought to also have been prepared to face an opponent, in Woods, who was a dispassionate adversary intent on making putts, not conversation.
McIlroy’s easy familiarity is with Woods, the friend and mentor. He sometimes practices with Woods, his South Florida neighbor, and he and his family regularly dine at the restaurant that Woods owns. McIlroy’s last two major victories came in 2014, the year of Woods’s worsening back problems, which led to four operations and two essentially lost seasons.
So as McIlroy’s stature was growing, he got only glimpses of Woods, the foe and mentalist whose competitive fire often reduced his would-be rivals to ash.
On Saturday, a sizable congregation of early-rising Woods worshipers watched a match of dueling personalities — Woods’s intensity versus McIlroy’s inclusivity. In the end, the edge belonged to Woods, whose 2-and-1 victory slowed McIlroy’s momentum as he rolls into Augusta for the Masters in two weeks.
In the afternoon quarterfinals, Lucas Bjerregaard sent Woods packing with a 1-up defeat, which Woods described as a snag in his pre-Masters preparation. “I was really hoping to play Sunday,” he said, referring to the semifinals and final.
Woods’s match against McIlroy, which ended when Woods drained a 15-foot par putt to halve the par-3 17th hole, began to turn on the par-4 fifth when McIlroy had an 8-foot birdie putt to go 1-up. He backed away from the attempt and waited for more than a minute while the players on an adjacent fairway hit their shots. The pause gave McIlroy plenty of time to think about the putt, which he then missed.
Funnily enough, McIlroy might have been one of the few people at the hole who was aware that there were others in action. This was Woods’s first appearance as a professional in Austin, and fans flocked to watch him play as if he may never again come their way.
McIlroy tried to draw Woods into casual conversation early in the match only to have his attempts peter out like short putts. They did not talk during a lengthy delay on the fifth tee while they waited for the fairway to clear. McIlroy idly bounced a ball several times on the face of his driver. Woods took his ball, placed it between his right index and middle fingers and flipped it in the air and caught it between the same two fingers, a sequence he repeated several times.
McIlroy missed a 3-footer to lose the 10th hole, extending Woods’s lead to 3-up. But as the weather turned, so, too, did the momentum. As the wind began to whip and a cold rain started to fall, McIlroy won the 12th and 13th holes with his first birdies of the day. The match looked as if it might be getting away from Woods when he hit his drive at the par-4 15th way left, where water lurked. But his ball bounced off someone or something and came to rest in grass trampled down by fans. After a great third shot, Woods sank a nervy 8-footer to match McIlroy’s par.
If Woods’s putter hurt McIlroy’s comeback hopes, the final blow was self-inflicted. On the par-5 16th, McIlroy’s drive traveled 395 yards. He was in the fairway, 173 yards from the pin, and somehow made what amounted to a 7 on the hole. With Woods on the green in three, McIlroy produced his worst swing of the day. The ball landed in the rough near the lip of a greenside bunker, and he pitched his next shot over the green as fans in the vicinity scattered.
The ball came to rest against a wooden bulkhead, and McIlroy took an unplayable lie, leading to Woods winning the hole without having to hit a putt. McIlroy was muttering to himself as he walked to the 17th tee, but after Woods ended the match on the 17th green, McIlroy had nothing to say.
He hopped into a cart and left the grounds without talking to reporters. It was a rare fit of pique from McIlroy, who has worked hard over the past year to moderate his emotions no matter what score he cards.
Had McIlroy learned from his loss to Woods that constraint can feed a competitor’s fire? It would appear not. In an Instagram post later in the day, McIlroy apologized for his abrupt departure and added that he would “learn and move on.”

It is a buyer’s market for consumers interested in buying property in a golf community, whether a hotel resort with residences or a residential-only development.
Gregory Nathan, the chief business officer for the National Golf Foundation, a golf market research provider, said that a building boom from 1986 to 2006 produced a flood of homes at top-quality golf courses, mostly in the United States but internationally, too.
“There is still plenty of supply to spare, and the competition among golf communities to woo buyers is fierce,” he said.
While interest in golf community homes waned after the 2008 recession, that is no longer the case, said Gregory Daco, the chief United States economist for Oxford Economics USA.
“The global economy is stronger, and people have more disposable income to spare, which means that they’re more apt to invest in secondary purchases like golf homes,” he said.
But before buyers decide to live in such a community, they should consider several factors. Here is advice on how to make an informed decision about buying a golf home:

IT’S ALL ABOUT THE LOCATION
First and foremost, even before looking at prospective properties, consider the destinations.
“You should like the idea of living where you’re looking,” said Patrick Melton, a co-founder and managing partner of South Street Partners, a private equity real estate investment firm based in Charlotte, N.C., and Charleston, S.C. The firm ownsKiawah Island Club, a golf community near Charleston with residences and two golf courses.
If you’ve spent time in and enjoy Miami or Spain’s Costa del Sol region, both of which have an abundance of golf communities, for example, seek out homes in these areas. On the flip side, if you’re enamored of countryside golf communities but don’t particularly like being in remote settings, look for a site that’s in a suburb and close to a city.
Many consumers fall in love with a golf community and buy a home there, Mr. Melton said, only to realize afterward that they’re not thrilled with the area.
Also, consider whether being near quality medical care, an international airport, noteworthy restaurants and an arts and culture scene is a priority.
“Your home could tick all the boxes in terms of what you’re looking for, but it may be an hour’s drive to a major grocery store or hospital, which could be a hassle,” Mr. Melton said.
And don’t forget about the weather. Some destinations are too cold to play golf or spend time outdoors in winter or may have a rainy or hurricane season, while others are almost too hot in summer, said Liz Rowlinson, editor of A Place in the Sun magazine, a division of the British-based real-estate consulting brand of the same name.
“If you want to play golf year-round and want a home that’s appealing to be in year-round, you should look for a property located in a region with a stable climate, save for maybe a few months,” she said.
But location also means the exact position of your home, Ms. Rowlinson said.
“Living right next to a green or fairway sounds idyllic but early morning mowers can be noisy, sprinklers come on during the night, and fast-moving golf balls landing in your pool is tiresome,” she said.
The bottom line is that if you’re sensitive to noise, the crack of tee shot drives is far louder than the murmur of greenside putts.
Similarly, you may like views across fairways, but will you be happy with golfers staring into your home as they pass by? A strategically placed line of bushes can provide privacy.
If you’re an avid golfer, the number of other good courses nearby should figure in, too; playing at your own club week after week may get dull.
“Ideally, you’d want at least a few public courses less than an hour’s drive from you, so you have the option for some variety when you play,” Ms. Rowlinson said.

FIND AN EXPERIENCED BROKER
More often than not, buyers interested in golf communities usually don’t work with brokers who are well informed about the areas they’re looking in, said Blake Plumley, the chief executive of Capital Pursuits, a development consulting firm specializing in resort residential communities. When interviewing potential brokers, ask them how many properties they have sold in the communities. Ideally, it should be several.
Also, inquire about three positive aspects and three drawbacks of living in those communities. “Your broker should be able to easily answer this,” Mr. Plumley said.
The broker should personally know the golf club’s membership director, the general manager, the head golf pro and a few other key figures in the communities. “You want a broker who can directly introduce you to these people,” Mr. Plumley said.

LOOK FOR KEY AMENITIES
Successful golf communities offer much more than golf — so much that they most likely attract plenty of nongolfing residents, Ms. Rowlinson said.
Desirable amenities include a clubhouse with more than one social gathering space, tennis courts, an outdoor pool with a grill area, a high-quality restaurant, a casual dining option and a bar. A family-friendly club is also important. The best communities have a robust lineup of activities for children and families, such as summer camps, boating and hiking excursions, pool days, fun food-themed dinners such as taco night and more.
“The more amenities a community has, the broader its appeal is, making your home more sellable if you ever look to move,” Mr. Melton said.

UNDERSTAND FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS
Living in a golf development comes with additional costs that could include club dues, property taxes and monthly maintenance fees. These costs can vary greatly from one community to the next, and while the home you are considering might be affordable, the price of living in the community could be exorbitant.
Also, some communities assess their residents, while others don’t. That means that residents are billed for the cost of projects such as a new health club or repairing the clubhouse’s leaky roof. Financially sound communities have a healthy cash reserve to pay for such projects (the exact number varies, depending on a community’s size and the scale of its amenities), but according to Mr. Plumley, some communities have no or limited money in reserve. Your broker will be able to give you that information.
“Be careful what you sign up for, because you could unexpectedly be out a few thousand dollars at any given time,” he said.
ARE YOU WILLING TO PLAY BY THE RULES?
All golf communities have regulations that residents are expected to follow. Mr. Melton said that buyers should be sure to understand what these rules are and decide whether they’re comfortable abiding by them.
One of the more significant rules is whether all residents are required to be members of the golf club. Whether you’re a golfer or not, it may be a smarter move to live in a community where you’re not required to be a member; otherwise, when you look to resell, a potential buyer base will be more limited.
And if you are interested in becoming a member, know what you are signing up for. If you ever move and need to give up your membership, for example, you may be required to pay dues until someone can take it over, which could take a few years.
“I know of instances where members have had to pay dues for five years after they’ve moved away,” Mr. Melton said.
Also, most communities have design guidelines, and you want to make sure that the aesthetic matches yours. For example, you most likely won’t be allowed to build an art deco home in a community where all the properties are built in a contemporary style.

ASK IF THE GOLF COURSE IS PROTECTED
Is there a chance of your community’s golf course closing so that homes or other structures can be built?
Ask your real-estate agent to find out. In some cases, a golf course is protected by its owner through a conservation easement or deed restriction stating that the land can never be anything but a course. But some courses are not protected, which means that the owners have the right to close them.
“I wouldn’t buy in communities where the golf course isn’t protected because your property has the potential to lose 25 percent or more of its value,” Mr. Plumley said.

PLAN TO HANG OUT FOR A WHILE
It’s vital to spend a few days actually living at a community you are interested in, Mr. Plumley said.
“You want to make sure that you’re comfortable and like being surrounded by the people who will be your neighbors,” he said.
Most communities offer discounted stays for serious buyers, who should take up the offer and play the golf course, use the pool and dine in the restaurants.
While you’re there, be sure to interact with the staff as much as possible, Mr. Melton said.
“In good golf communities, many of the employees have been around for decades, and you should definitely like them, because they’re the ones who are going to be helping you,” he said.

An undocumented immigrant who worked at one of President Trump’s golf clubs in New Jersey for years and recently spoke out about her experience will attend his State of the Union address after being invited by her Democratic congresswoman, the woman’s lawyer and the congresswoman’s office said Wednesday.
The undocumented immigrant, Victorina Morales, had worked as a housekeeper at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., since 2013, and spoke to The New York Times aspart of an article published last month. The report revealed that the president’s company — the Trump Organization — was, for years, employing people at the golf club who are in the country illegally.
In a brief interview on Wednesday, Ms. Morales said that on the advice of her lawyer, she stopped going to work on Dec. 4, two days before the Times article was published. Still, the lawyer, Anibal Romero, said that neither he nor his client had received notice that she had been fired. He said Ms. Morales’s employment status with the golf club was not entirely clear.
Since leaving her job, Ms. Morales, who is from Guatemala, has campaigned for rights and fair treatment for undocumented immigrants. On Wednesday, she said she was pleased to have been invited tothe State of the Union, that she has accepted the invitation and that she was “very proud because I am going to raise my voice for all of us immigrants.”
“I’m not scared to show my face,” she said, speaking in Spanish. “I am not speaking for me, I’m speaking on behalf of millions of undocumented immigrants who live in the United States.”
The congresswoman, Bonnie Watson Coleman, represents the New Jersey district in which Ms. Morales lives. The news that Ms. Morales had been invited to attend Tuesday’s State of the Union address as Ms. Watson Coleman’s guest was reported byThe Washington Poston Wednesday.
“Immigrants by and large are hardworking, trustworthy and skilled people who simply want to work and build better lives here,” Ms. Watson Coleman said in a statement. “For years these kinds of people were loyal and dedicated enough to be Trump Organization employees. I hope that in his State of the Union address, Donald Trump will finally acknowledge the real face of immigrants in this country — women and children fleeing violence; law-abiding, taxpaying people who would do almost anything to be Americans. And if he can’t, I’ve invited Victorina so that he may look her in her eyes to tell his lies to a familiar face.”
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday evening.
Mr. Trump has made border security and protecting jobs for Americans cornerstones of his presidency, and his insistence on building a border wall led to the recent partial government shutdown. He has labeled illegal immigration “a major, major problem,” and pledged to build a border wall while his administration has carried out workplace raids and payroll audits.
The Times article, published Dec. 6, said undocumented immigrants had been employed for years at the Trump National Golf Club as housekeepers, landscapers and kitchen staff. It also said they were kept on the payroll even though management was aware they had used phony documents to secure employment, as is common among undocumented immigrants.
Ms. Morales previously told The Times that a manager at Bedminster had helped her secure a new fake Social Security number and legal permanent-residency card after telling her that those on file had expired.
Since the article was published, about a dozen workers deemed ineligible to work in the United States because they lacked legal immigration status have been terminated at the Bedminster club, according to people familiar with the matter.
Another dozen were fired at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County, N.Y.,this month, a development first reportedby The Washington Post.
The Trump Organization also said late Tuesday that it wasputting in place a system to weed out undocumented immigrants who try to get jobsat its properties.
“I must say, for me personally, this whole thing is truly heartbreaking,” Eric Trump, an executive vice president with the Trump Organization, said in the statement on Tuesday. “Our employees are like family, but when presented with fake documents, an employer has little choice.”
He said that hiring undocumented immigrants was not a problem unique to the Trump Organization, and that it “demonstrates that our immigration system is severely broken and needs to be fixed immediately.”

PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. — The celebration was muted, even if Pebble Beach Golf Links was at its most radiant on Monday morning, with clear skies and bright sunshine casting the Pacific Ocean, the 18th hole and Phil Mickelson in an exquisite light. Mickelson turned to Paul Casey, the player he had vanquished to win his fifth Pebble Beach Pro-Am title after a lengthy weather delay, to thank him for helping produce the sublime stagecraft.
With Casey carrying a three-stroke lead into the final round, Mickelson was forced to bear down over the final 18, and he produced a seven-under 65 in the final round. Mickelson’s 72-hole total was 19-under 268, three strokes better than Casey, a friend and fellow Arizona State alumnus.
So focused was Mickelson during the last round that he tried to persuade Casey and tournament officials to finish the final two holes amid fading light Sunday evening.
Casey, who ended up winning the team event with his amateur partner, Don Colleran, declined to play on, and after they both finished with a par and birdie on the final holes in front of a robust crowd of early risers the next morning, Mickelson gave credit where it was due.
“Paul made the tough call, but it was the right decision,” Mickelson said, adding, “Sometimes I just get in my own little bubble and I don’t see the big picture.”
Mickelson’s decision-making in the caldron of competition can sometimes be a liability, as was evident in his collapse on the final hole of the 2006 U.S. Open at Winged Foot — or more recently, in his decision to one-timea moving puttduring the third round of last year’s U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills.
But in closing out his 44th PGA Tour victory this week, Mickelson, 48, was a study in restraint. After his birdie putt at the 18th hole dropped, he picked the ball out of the hole as though he were retrieving a package from his front stoop. It was Mickelson’s second victory in nearly a year — he won the World Golf Championships event in Mexico City last March — and his first on U.S. soil in 2,199 days, since he captured the 2013 Waste Management Phoenix Open.
Any victory is special at Pebble Beach, a historic venue with personal resonance for Mickelson and his family, but he hopes a more meaningful celebration on the 18th green awaits him in June, for the 119th U.S. Open — the only major tournament that Mickelson has not won.
Can he strike gold twice at Pebble Beach in the same year? Two men have proved it’s possible; Jack Nicklaus in 1972, on his way to a seven-victory season, and Tiger Woods in 2000, when he won nine PGA Tour events. Nicklaus was in his 30s in 1972 and Woods in his 20s in 2000, both at the peak of their powers.
Mickelson will turn 49 on the final day of this year’s U.S. Open, and a win would make him the oldest men’s major champion, surpassing Julius Boros, who was 48 when he won the 1968 P.G.A. Championship. Mickelson’s younger brother and caddie, Tim, suggested people discount Mickelson’s chances at their peril.
“He’s won twice now in the last 11 months,” Tim Mickelson said, adding, “Obviously it shows he can win still.”
Mickelson’s game appears to be aging as well as did the bottle of 1990 Romanée-Conti wine that he drank from the Claret Jug after winning the 2013 British Open. He has a second and a first in his last three starts — with a missed cut at the Phoenix Open sandwiched in between. The resurgence of Mickelson and the 43-year-old Woods has made the men’s game infinitely more compelling.
“I believe that if I play my best, if Tiger plays his best, it’s good enough to win on any week,” Mickelson said, adding, “I just think that both myself and Tiger are going to have a really, really good year.”
Mickelson and Woods both have found their way to the winner’s circle more recently than either Jordan Spieth or Rory McIlroy have. Like Mickelson, Spieth and McIlroy are each one major title from completing a career Grand Slam. McIlroy, 29, will get his opportunity first, at the Masters in April. Spieth’s turn will come next, at the P.G.A. Championship in May.
And then the spotlight will settle like a laser beam on Mickelson, who played his first major as a pro at the 1992 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach. He noted that this year marked the 100th anniversary of his maternal grandfather’s debut as a pre-teen caddie at Pebble Beach, where he made 25 cents a round.
During the greenside trophy presentation, Mickelson told the story of how his grandfather, Al Santos, who grew up in Monterey, Calif., dropped out of school in the fourth grade to help support his family and shortly thereafter found his way to the Pebble Beach caddie shack.
Mickelson said his grandfather carried a 1900 silver dollar in his pocket while he worked, and passed it down to Mickelson, who uses it as a ball marker whenever he plays here. Mickelson describes the place as special now, but after he missed the cut at the 1992 U.S. Open, he skipped the Tour stop here in 1993 and 1994.
“I don’t know I had a good big picture of the overall importance of the tournament to the game and what it provides and how much I love the place,” Mickelson explained in 2012.
Playing Pebble Beach has taught Mickelson to take nothing for granted. He was trailing by two strokes after 36 holes in 1996 but never got a chance to make a charge as inclement weather washed out the final two rounds. Two years later, Mickelson successfully outlasted Mother Nature and the field for his first Pebble Beach Pro-Am title.
In 1998, the tournament’s first two rounds were played in stormy weather in February, which rendered the course soft and the greens slow, and the final round took place under bright sunshine in August, and the course was fast and firm — as it should be in June for the U.S. Open. In winning his first pro-am title, Mickelson might have acquired the blueprint for realizing his last major goal in golf.
“I have such great memories here,” Mickelson said. “I would love to add to it.”
But Mickelson added that he wouldn’t allow himself to look any further ahead than the Masters. He has spent so long fixated on winning the U.S. Open, but this week taught him the beauty that can reward those who see the big picture.

Marilynn Smith, who help found the Ladies Professional Golf Association in 1950, when the women’s game was barely a blip on the national sports scene, and went on to win 21 tour events, including two major championships, died on Tuesday in Goodyear, Ariz. She was 89.
Her death, which wasannounced by the L.P.G.A.on its website, leftMarlene Bauer HaggeandShirley Sporkas the last survivors among the 13 pioneers of the women’s tour.
The L.P.G.A. said Smith, who would have turned 90 on Saturday, made her last public appearance on March 24 greeting players as they walked off the 18th green at the Bank of Hope Founders Cup tournament in Phoenix.
During its first season, the L.P.G.A. sponsored a dozen or so tournaments, with prize money totaling just $50,000.Babe Didrikson Zaharias, an Olympic track and field champion in 1932, andPatty Bergwere the main draws at first, but Smith, as well as co-founders like Hagge,Louise SuggsandBetty Jameson, became prominent golf pros in their own right.
Last year, the L.P.G.A. sponsored 32 events in 13 countries with $65.35 million in prize money.
Smith captured the 1963 and 1964 Titleholders Championship, an L.P.G.A. major tournament of her era, which was played at Augusta Country Club in Georgia, adjacent to Augusta National Golf Club, the home of the Masters. She won her first L.P.G.A. tournament in 1954 and her last in 1972.
While serving as L.P.G.A. president from 1958 to 1960, Smith was instrumental in founding the organization’s teaching division, now known as the L.P.G.A. Teaching and Club Professional Membership. She gave clinics throughout the United States and in 37 other countries and was the first woman to be a television analyst for men’s pro golf tournaments. She worked with ABC at the 1973 United States Open, at Oakmont in Pennsylvania, and the Colonial, in Fort Worth.
She was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2006.
The L.P.G.A. was the successor to the Women’s Professional Golf Association, which was founded during World War II but disbanded in 1949 after incurring financial difficulties. In the L.P.G.A.’s early years, it struggled as well, receiving little notice in the press or on the radio and having no TV exposure.
The women also lacked the funds to fly, sothey traveled to tournaments in caravansof four or five automobiles when the interstate highway system was in its infancy.
When they reached a tournament site, they had to sell their product to the locals. Smith, an exuberant woman who seemed just right for publicizing the tour, was given the nickname Miss Personality for her cheerleading.
“We would go to major league ball parks, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Washington, D.C., and hit golf balls from home plate out to center field, with a 9 or an 8 iron, and then we’d get on the microphone and ask those baseball fans to come out and see the L.P.G.A. play,” she told The Arizona Republic long afterward.
The women were also the tournament directors and rules makers, and they called in results to the news agencies and newspapers. Tournament sites came and went. “We might get one event one year; the next year it was gone,” Smith told The Dallas Morning News in 2000.
Marilynn Smith was born on April 29, 1929, in Topeka, Kan., to Lynn and Alma Smith. Her father was an insurance executive.
In her pre-teenage years, Marilynn managed and pitched for a boys’ baseball team. As she once told golf.com: “I came home from pitching one day and my mother said, ‘Well, how did you do today, dear?’ I threw my mitt against the wall and I said, ‘Oh, —,’ a four-letter word beginning with S that I had learned from the boys on the sandlot. And she marched me into the lavatory and washed my mouth out with soap.”
When her father came home and learned of her outburst, she recalled, he said, “We better take her out to the Wichita Country Club and teach her a more ladylike sport.”
Her childhood dream was to play baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals, but she agreed to take golf lessons from a country-club pro. Captivated by the sport, she went on to win three state amateur championships and the 1949 national collegiate golf championship as a sophomore at the University of Kansas. She turned pro after that when the Spalding sporting goods company gave her a contract to promote its equipment at clinics.
Smith received the first Patty Berg Award for distinguished service to women’s golf in 1979. In her later years she sponsored a tournament raising scholarship money for female high school seniors planning to continue to play golf in college. Living in Goodyear, a suburb of Phoenix, she played recreationally until she was about 70, when her knees gave out. There was no immediate word on her survivors.
Smith estimated that she had given 4,000 clinics in the United States and abroad. On one of her four trips to New Zealand, she inspired a 10-year-old girl named Marilyn Smith to take up golf. In the 1970s, thatMarilyn Smithbecame the first pro player from her country to join the L.P.G.A. Tour.
“With Marilynn Smith as a founding member still playing, they called me MJ Smith,” she once told Wellington Golf, which advises golf clubs in the vicinity of New Zealand’s capital. “Though they did send one of my prize checks to her by mistake.”
An earlier version of this obituary misstated the location in Georgia of the Titleholders Championship, which Smith won in 1963 and 1964. It was Augusta Country Club, not Augusta National Golf Club.

By Manny Fernandez in Donna, Tex.
It’s springtime on the border, and that means the winter season is winding down — the months when tens of thousands of retirees from Minnesota, South Dakota, Illinois and other parts of the Midwest adopt South Texas as their home away from home.
Retirees in swimsuits ride their bicycles to the pool, bright noodles tucked under their arms like jousting lances. They line the streets for golf-cart parades. They venture into Mexico, shopping for cheap medicine, getting pedicures, undergoing low-cost dental work and sipping goblet-sized margaritas.
They are known as Winter Texans, and they concentrate mainly in the Rio Grande Valley, the temperate region deep in South Texas that is also the place where the largest number of migrants has been crossing lately from Central America — President Trump has declared a national emergency along the border and stationed Army troops to help control the escalating influx. One of their base camps was a quarter-mile from where seniors at the Victoria Palms resort in Donna deploy by the dozens to occupy five pickleball courts.
The annual invasion of Midwesterners — and a number of Canadians — has decreased in recent years, but they remain an economic and cultural force. An estimated 106,000 Winter Texans spent about $528 million in the valley in the 2017-18 winter season, according to a survey by the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. Tex-Mex restaurants fly welcome banners for them. There are Winter Texan newspapers, age-qualified RV parks, expos, cruises, theater productions and bumper stickers — one pickup truck in the border city of McAllen had two: “Iowa Winter Texan” and “I’m retired. Go around.”
“It gets me out of the snowbanks,” said Dean Miller, 58, a resident of Detroit Lakes, Minn., who spends the winter living and working at the Winter Ranch resort in Alamo. “You’ll go to some event down here and you’ll find your neighbor from back home.”
The majority of Winter Texans are white and in their early 70s. Many of them voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, and their very presence this winter quietly subverted the president’s assertion that the border is in crisis. They have been coming to the region for years — in some cases, their parents were Winter Texans, too — and the political dynamics and national-emergency rhetoric has no effect on how, or where, they spend their retirement.
“We don’t see what you see on TV,” said Terry Goss, the general manager of Victoria Palms, one of the largest Winter Texan communities, with up to 2,500 retirees.
What do Winter Texans see, exactly?
A slice of border life that looks nothing like what many Americans think of as border life. There was Nathan’s fourth annual Sock Hop at Ranchero Village in Weslaco one Friday. There were fish frys and riverboat tours, line dancing and karaoke sessions, bluegrass acoustic jams and nondenominational church services. At the Winter Ranch resort in Alamo one Monday afternoon, the Winter Ranch Players packed the house with three one-act plays, “The Ethel and Albert Comedies.” At Victoria Palms, Mr. Goss spoke standing next to a poster listing all the sold-out shows at the resort’s ballroom, one of them a Rolling Stones tribute band concert. Victoria Palms is so popular with Canadians that a Victoria Palms reunion is scheduled most summers near Toronto.
Margaret Hitzemann, 63, who normally lives in Onamia, Minn., spent the past two months in a townhouse in Port Aransas, near Corpus Christi. One rainy afternoon, she and her husband visited the Mexican tourist town of Nuevo Progreso. They bought crispy chapulines — crickets, a fried delicacy — and went into a pharmacy to buy some cheap medicine.
“We don’t take a lot of meds, so we were thinking, ‘Oh, let’s go down and get some cheap Tylenol and Advil and that kind of thing,’” Ms. Hitzemann said. “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, this isn’t any cheaper than Walmart.’ So we ended up not buying any medications.”
In a region with a large Latino population and tolerant attitudes toward immigration — many people have family members on both sides of the border — culture clash with the Northerners is inevitable. The study released by the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley included unedited messages from Winter Texans to local officials, and some of the sharpest comments read: “Be more American, less Mexican. This is not Mexico!” and “Have channel 5 respect Mr. Trump” and “Keep the grass cut, the trash picked up and speak English.”
Already, the exodus back north has started. The end of the season for many comes on Thursday, with the annual Winter Texan appreciation day in Nuevo Progreso.
For some, the season never ends. There are Converted Texans, former Winter Texans who settle in the valley for good. Kristi Collier, a McAllen native who runs a media and hospitality company that caters to Winter Texans called Welcome Home, Rio Grande Valley, hosts an annual Converted Texan Fiesta in April. (She leads a swearing-in ceremony.)
Among the ranks of the converted are Ken and Lois Lane, originally from Anchorage, who started spending winters at Victoria Palms in 2005. They now live there permanently in a double-wide mobile home.
“I think the cost of living here is very reasonable, compared to many other places,” said Mr. Lane, 73, a retired power dispatcher for an electrical company.
He and his wife visited Nuevo Progreso and hosted their son and his family from Iowa over spring break. The couple is in a unique category: sort of reverse Winter Texans.
“The motor home we kept and in the summer when it gets real hot, we go up north,” Mr. Lane said.

“There are people out there who just say, ‘Send them all back and build a wall.’ But they would be facing empty shelves in the grocery store if that were to happen.”
— Mike McMahon, a dairy farmer in upstate New York.
The farms of upstate New York are thousands of miles from the southern border, but close enough to the northern one that the Border Patrol has jurisdiction. Farmers’ reliance on undocumented workers had made the region a focal point in the debate over the Trump administration’s border policies, leading to tensions between state politicians of both parties and the federal agents enforcing the president’s crackdown on illegal immigration.
Christina Goldbaum, an immigration reporter in The New York Times’s Metro department, explored Mr. McMahon’s story, and those of migrants who work at farms like his, in an article this week.Read more about it here.
This week, KPBS, a public radio station in Southern California, launched a new podcast, “Only Here,” about life and culture in San Diego and Tijuana — “the art, food, traditions and culture that exists because of the border,” they write. The first episode profiles a young photographer who is gay and undocumented,and you can listen to it, along with other episodes, here.
Podcast creators, like everyone else, have been drawn to stories and conversations about the border. If you prefer your stories in audio form, here are a few more to get you started:

• Last spring, WNYC’s Radiolab ran “Border Project,” a three-part series about a Border Patrol policy that most likely led to a rise, beginning in the late 1990s, in the number of migrants who died while crossing to the United States. It also profiles some of the migrants who made the trek despite it.Listen to all the episodes here.
• This episode of PRX’s Radio Diaries, “The Border Wall,” focuses on those strange parts of the border that one woman calls a “no-man’s land,” cut off from their country by a barrier that doesn’t always follow the line it’s meant to.
• Our very own “Daily” podcast has many great episodes from the border. Start with a two-part series, “Dispatches From the Border” (Part 1 hereandPart 2 here), which follows Azam Ahmed, the Times bureau chief for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, and other Times journalists on a trip along the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico. Then there’s this episode, “The Scars of Family Separation,” about a migrant father who crossed the border with his daughter. Finally, from last summer, “How Separating Migrant Families Became U.S. Policy” is an interview with Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser who has helped the president frame his immigration policy.

NAUCALPAN DE JUÁREZ, Mexico — Nine holes into his record-tying round Sunday, Justin Thomas bumped into Rory McIlroy, who was waiting to tee off on the first hole at Club de Golf Chapultepec. He said he asked McIlroy how he thought the afternoon would go.
McIlroy began the final day of the Mexico Championship four strokes behind Dustin Johnson, a deficit that was daunting but hardly insurmountable; the previous Sunday, J. B. Holmes charged from four strokes back to beat Thomas at the Genesis Open.
McIlroy told Thomas it would be hard to catch Johnson because of how well he was playing, a prediction that proved to be hit-the-flagstick accurate. Johnson, who was sixth on the PGA Tour in driving distance last year, ranked first in this week’s field in putting. It was an unbeatable combination as Johnson closed with a five-under-par 66 to finish five strokes clear of McIlroy, who posted a 67.
Johnson’s 72-hole total in this World Golf Championships event outside Mexico City was 19 under. McIlroy finished at 16 under, which would have been good enough to win each of the previous two years that the tournament was held here. On Sunday, all it got McIlroy was a five-stroke cushion over the third-place finishers: Paul Casey (65), Ian Poulter (68) and Kiradech Aphibarnrat (68).
Tiger Woods recorded a 69 to finish in a four-way tie for 10th at eight under.
“It was sort of like there was two different golf tournaments going on and I won the second one,” said McIlroy, who has posted top-five finishes in all four of his tour starts in 2019.
Thomas, who played in the first group off the back nine, took advantage of pristine greens and nonexistent pressure to record a 62, tying his year-old course record, vaulting him into ninth. His score represented a 13-stroke improvement over his final 18 last Sunday at Riviera Country Club.
“I would sure play a lot of money to switch the two,” Thomas said with a smile. “I would gladly take a 50th place this week to win last week.”
Johnson, 34, became the first player since Davis Love III in 2008 to reach 20 PGA Tour titles. “To get 20 wins out here is very difficult, and do it before I turn 35 is pretty incredible,” Johnson said, adding, “This is a big one for me, and it gives me a lot of confidence for the rest of the year.”
Johnson is not lacking for confidence. He has two victories and a tie for ninth in his last four starts. He also extended his streak of seasons with at least one tour title to 12, an emphatic argument for his inclusion among the finest players in the men’s game (Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer share the record at 17, one better than Billy Casper and three more than Woods).
McIlroy, 29, also extended a streak, this one more enigmatic. Since January of last year, he has played his way into the last group for the final round eight times — without emerging triumphant. McIlroy’s lone title run in that stretch came at Bay Hill last March when he started the final round in the next-to-last group.
To mount a charge, McIlroy needed to get off to the kind of hot start engineered by Casey, who teed off four groups ahead and birdied the first three holes. Johnson started shakily, playing the first five holes in one over, but McIlroy, despite making a birdie at the second, could not swing the momentum his way. He did not find a fairway off the tee until the eighth hole and he missed a birdie putt of 11 feet on the first hole and a 6-footer for par on the fourth.
After playing the first nine in one over, McIlroy settled for par on No. 10, which Johnson birdied. At that point, McIlroy said, his caddie, Harry Diamond, told him to forget about trying to catch Johnson and concentrate on consolidating second place.
“I knew at that point that I didn’t have a chance; D. J. was playing too well,” McIlroy said.
McIlroy covered the final eight holes in five under and all he could do was equal Johnson’s final-nine 31.
“I felt like I was standing still,” McIlroy said with a laugh. “I was making birdies and going nowhere.”
The other member of the final threesome on Sunday was Patrick Reed, who was grouped with McIlroy on Sunday at last year’s Masters and claimed the green jacket with a 71 to McIlroy’s 74. That was McIlroy’s second cubic zirconia in the lustrous string. The fourth was the World Golf Championships event in Ohio, where he could not overcome Thomas’s three-stroke advantage. The sixth was the Tour Championship, where he started three behind Woods. The seventh was the Tournament of Champions, where Xander Schauffele shot a 62 to leapfrog into first.
“I’ve played well, I’ve done what I’ve wanted to do and needed to do,” McIlroy said, adding: “My game’s right there. I’m really happy with everything. I’ve just got to stay patient, look at the positives and just keep persisting and putting myself in positions, and sooner or later hopefully it will go my way.”
Golf could not be going much better for Johnson, who became the fifth player in the last 50 years to collect 20 wins before his 35th birthday, joining Woods, Phil Mickelson, Tom Watson and Johnny Miller.
“It’s very sweet,” Johnson said. “It’s been a lot of hard to get here, but it feels really good. I’m very proud of myself.”
An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a milestone reached by Dustin Johnson. He is the fifth golfer int he 50 years to collect 20 wins before his 35th birthday, not the fifth golfer over all to do so.

AUSTIN. Tex. — Kevin Kisner made it to the World Golf Championships match play final for the second straight year. This time, he got it right.
A week that began with a loss ended on Sunday with the biggest victory of Kisner’s career when he holed a 20-foot birdie putt to close out Matt Kuchar, 3 and 2, at a chilly Austin Country Club.
“It was a long week. I prevailed. And I’m a world golf champion,” Kisner said off the 16th green.
He became the first player to win the event after losing in the final the previous year. That one was not close, as Bubba Watson ended the match in 12 holes.
Kisner never trailed against Kuchar, though it was tight at the turn until Kuchar made too many mistakes. He missed a 12-foot putt on the 10th that would have tied the match, and on his next swing put his tee shot into the water on the par-3 11th.
Given a 2-up lead, Kisner took it from there. He halved holes by making putts from 6 feet and 4 feet, and then seized control on the 15th when Kuchar’s chip was too strong and led to another lost hole. It was Kisner’s third PGA Tour victory, his first since 2017.
Kuchar, who still moved to the top of the FedEx Cup standings, said:“I gave too many holes away. I knew against Kisner I couldn’t do it.”
Kisner had to play 120 holes over seven matches in five days, a week that began with a loss to Ian Poulter in group play. Kisner, who finished in a tie for second behind Francesco Molinari in the British Open last year, became the first player to win the match play world event with a loss during the round-robin portion, which began in 2015.
“If you’d have told me I’d be sitting here 10 years ago, I would probably have said you were crazy,” said the 35-year-old Kisner, who was playing on minitours at that time.
“I think it shows in my grind. That’s what I do. I’ve had ups and downs throughout it. I’ve won on every tour, every level. And had tremendous downfalls on every tour and every level. So I pride myself in the way I pick myself up and keep grinding.”
Kisner and Kuchar each had 1-up victories in the semifinals. Kisner had to get past Molinari, who had never had to play the 18th hole in five previous matches this week. Kuchar, who won the event in 2013, had to beat Lucas Bjerregaard, who had knocked out Tiger Woods in the quarterfinals. .

NAUCALPAN DE JUÁREZ, Mexico — From where he stood on the fairway on the par-5 15th hole, all Tiger Woods could see on Saturday were the possibilities. He was eight under par for the tournament and stalking a final-round, final-threesome grouping in his Mexico Championship debut.
Standing several yards from Woods, also in the fairway, John Sutcliffe, who is covering the tournament for ESPN and ESPN Deportes, could see all the way to Sunday night.
Sutcliffe, who grew up in a house along the 10th hole of the course, Club de Golf Chapultepec, said, “I was thinking, when it gets to be the final hole of the tournament, maybe the Tiger roar will be in Spanish.”
But elsewhere on the course, Dustin Johnson was pulling away from the field, and No. 15 was about to undo Woods.
His 54-hole total of six under left him tied for ninth in this World Golf Championships event, well out of the final group and 10 strokes behind Johnson, who carded a 66 for a four-shot lead over his closest competitor, Rory McIlroy.
Still the headliner is indisputably Woods, who took 24 years and 381 starts to make his first appearance as a professional in Mexico.
He has drawn large, ardent crowds here, just outside Mexico City. After waiting so long to see Woods up close, the followers were not about to let a few errant swings or wayward putts ruin the festive mood. On Saturday, they shouted things like, “Tiger, Marry My Sister!” and serenaded him with cries of “Tiger” until he disappeared into the scoring room.
Woods’s caddie, Joe LaCava, described Woods as “like Michael Jordan down here” and said the fans were so excited to see him in person, “they didn’t even care where the shots were going.”
At 15, his second shot found a greenside bunker, and he chunked his next shot out of the sand, leaving him a 25-footer for birdie. Woods’s first putt rolled four feet past the hole, and he three-putted from there for a double-bogey 7. It was the 12th four-putt of his career, and it killed momentum. He made bogey on the next hole — also after his tee shot found the fairway — before salvaging a 1-under 70 with a closing birdie.
One of the fans who followed Woods for each of his first three rounds was Sebastian Mondragon, 13, who said he started playing golf when he was 9. He ran from spot to spot, positioning himself so he could try to draw Woods’s attention to a handmade sign that featured the face of a tiger and the exhortation, “Let’s Go, Tiger.”
As Woods walked from the eighth green to the ninth tee, Mondragon stood at the front of the rope line. He waved the sign and shouted Woods’s name, but the 14-time major champion walked past, staring straight ahead.
Mondragon said he hoped that watching Woods would offer some pointers. “What I’ve learned,” Mondragon said, “is he has a very good focus.”
Woods had a lot to process as he headed to the ninth tee. He bent his 9-iron on the eighth hole when he hit a tree during his swing, so the club was out of commission for the rest of the round. He sorely missed it on the 14th hole, when he had the perfect distance for a 9-iron approach.
Using his pitching wedge instead, Woods came up short but still managed par. On the 16th hole, LaCava said, Woods had to lay back off the tee to set up an 8-iron approach.
After the round, Woods, 43, received therapy on his surgically repaired back, LaCava said that after that, his boss intended to meet with a club repairer in hopes of fixing his 9-iron in time for Sunday’s round.
Whatever happens in the final 18 holes, Woods’s debut here will go down as an unqualified hit. In his gallery Saturday was a couple, originally from Portugal, who are living in Mexico City. This was their first time at a golf tournament, they said, and they stopped along the ninth fairway so the husband, Pedro Caixinha, could take a photograph of his wife, Anabela David, with Woods walking in the background.
Caixinha described the photograph as “a souvenir.”
Before the tournament, Sutcliffe told Woods that his presence would make this the most important week in the golf course’s nearly 100-year history. Then he presented Woods with his own souvenir: a bottle of tequila.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — As Patrick Reed surveyed his second shot, he seemed to have a dozen worries on his mind.
Which way was the wind blowing? Where on the green should he land his ball? Would the fans in his peripheral vision stop moving?
In a sport where the ball is still and the mind is active, and where distractions from unruly fans, bad bounces or sudden gusts of wind abound, focus can be difficult to maintain. But during the first round of the 2018 Tour Championship in Atlanta, it became nearly impossible. Reed took one last look at his target and what he saw nearly made his head go haywire.
Why was his estranged father standing behind the green?
No one on the PGA Tour these days has his powers of concentration tested as much as Reed, whose sometimes brash personality generates intense reaction among his peers and the public alike. For every person like the two-time major winner Curtis Strange, who said that he admires Reed’s self-belief, there are dozens who will never forgive him for proclaiming himself “a top-five player in the world” when he was 23 years old and ranked No. 20.
Yet easily the worst distraction that Reed faces any week, but especially this one, when he will defend the Masters title he won last year, is the possibility that at any moment he will look up and come face-to-face with the most painful chapter of his life.
Reed’s parents live six miles from Augusta National Golf Club, in a two-story, Southern-style Colonial replete with a bedroom shrine to their first child and only son, who hasn’t stepped foot in the house since 2012. This week should be a joyous homecoming for Reed, who led Augusta State (now Augusta University) to back-to-back national championships and will preside over Tuesday’s legends-laden Champions dinner. But instead it has all the makings of a nightmare, with his acrimonious relationship with his family threatening to become as much a part of this year’s Masters narrative as his attempt to become the first golfer since Tiger Woods in 2002 to successfully defend his title.
“I wouldn’t at all be surprised if they show up,” Reed said.
Reed, 28, has steadfastly declined to speak publicly about the reasons for the family schism. In a Sports Illustrated story in 2015, Reed’s mother insinuated that the rift resulted from Reed’s marriage, at age 22, to the former Justine Karain, against the advice of his parents who worried that he was too young.
Reed’s parents were not invited to last year’s Masters, when their son held off a challenge from Rickie Fowler and Jordan Spieth down the stretch, just as they were not invited to his 2012 wedding. They have not met either of his two young children. To attend this week’s tournament, they will have to enter the grounds with badges they did not obtain from him.
Last year the drama was confined to the course, but in the year since, Reed said he knew of two occasions in which his father and younger sister, Hannah, followed him at golf tournaments. Their motivation remains a mystery. When contacted for this article, Reed’s parents politely declined to comment. In an email, Reed’s mother replied, “At this time we have no comment on this subject and we hope you will respect the privacy of Hannah, Bill and myself.”
Danny Coulson, a former deputy assistant director of the F.B.I. who directs the PGA Tour’s security, saw Reed’s father at the first of the two events where Reed also noticed him, last September’s Tour Championship at Atlanta’s East Lake Golf Club. Coulson said he had cordially explained to Bill Reed what he and his staff have expressed over the years to Patrick: If Reed’s father wishes to watch golf, he is free to do so unless he does or says anything that would warrant his ejection.
Reed had other guests at the Tour Championship. He is extremely close to the Karains. One of Justine’s brothers, Kessler Karain, is his caddie and another of her brothers, Dan Karain, was visiting from Texas to lend his support. Justine stayed home in Houston that week, but from his spot in the gallery, Dan Karain was the first to recognize Reed’s father and sister behind East Lake’s fifth green as Reed was preparing to hit.
Reed said afterward that he wasn’t aware that his father and sister were there until the par-4 17th hole, when he was sizing up his approach shot and he noticed them standing along the rope line behind the green. He said he immediately tried to steer his focus back to golf.
Reed was wild off the tee that day, hitting only six fairways, but later said his problems were strictly self-inflicted. If he had noticed his father and sister on the front nine, he said, “I would have called for security to throw them out.” But those were his emotions boiling over after a round so frustrating that he went straight to the range after signing his scorecard and hit dozens of balls.
The week after the Tour Championship, Reed’s father and sister made the 4,300-mile trek to Paris for the Ryder Cup, where they followed Reed during his Sunday singles victory. Reed never saw them, he said, but members of his inner circle did, and they said they spent the afternoon tracking both Reed’s play and Bill and Hannah’s movements. As the Americans’ upset loss to the Europeans was winding down, only a few people close to Reed knew about the drama unfolding outside the gallery ropes.
Reed acknowledged later that he understands intellectually that if his father, mother or sister wants to watch him play, there is nothing he can do about it.
The Masters spectator’s guide has clear rules for patrons: No cheering a player’s misfortune and no inane or profane outbursts. Any violators are subject to immediate removal. But no rules exist to address a player’s estranged parents following their son.
At the 2014 United States Open in Pinehurst, N.C., Reed’s parents attended the second round using badges they had obtained from friends. Upon spotting them in Reed’s gallery, Reed’s agent expressed concerns to the U.S.G.A. security officers. On Monday, the U.S.G.A., in response to questions from The New York Times about the incident, said its security officials opted to escort Reed’s parents off the course and confiscate their badges after local law enforcement officers observed Bill Reed making what they described as “intimidating movements” toward Reed’s wife.
“Patrick and Justine Reed had no involvement in this decision,” the U.S.G.A. said.
Phillip B. Costa Jr., the manager and lawyer for Team Reed Enterprises, said that Reed had not reached out to Augusta National officials to request any special security this week.
Reed knows his on-course persona makes him a convenient villain. He is the cocky player who speaks his mind and walks the course leading with his chin, the former college delinquent whose underage drinking and other immature behavior, which hastened his departure from Georgia after one year, continues to trail him as a pro.
Rory McIlroy, who lost to Reed in a riveting singles match at the 2016 Ryder Cup and was paired with — and outplayed by — Reed in the final round of last year’s Masters, said: “The negative perception is all from hearsay, it’s all secondhand. I truly believe you can only base and judge someone’s character on how they’ve treated you. And Patrick’s always treated me well.”
McIlroy added, “He’s got a bit of an edge, and I think you need that to be successful out here.”
At a tournament in Germany last year, Reed called out a television crew member for jiggling coins as he was preparing to hit. At a playoff event outside Boston, Reed posed for a selfie at a Red Sox game and posted it to his Twitter feed criticizing his PGA Tour-issued seats — from which he had a crystal-clear view of his peer Justin Thomas, another major winner in his 20s, throwing out the first pitch.
And at the end of last year’s Ryder Cup, Reed even questioned the pairing decisions of Jim Furyk, the American captain.
“Does he ask for a little bit of it?” Dustin Johnson, who was a squad mate of Reed’s in Paris, said in reference to the fans’ vitriol. “Yeah,” said Johnson, who added that he likes Reed. “But I promise you, he doesn’t care what people say.”
Well, maybe a little. The Monday after last year’s Players Championship, Reed spoke with Ross Berlin, the tour’s senior vice president for player relations, on the putting green at the next stop on the schedule. Reed described the heckling he had endured at the tour’s flagship event, which included taunts like, “Everybody hates you, Reed!” Berlin listened intently and took notes.
When Reed was finished, Berlin promised that the tour’s security would do a better job rooting out the unruliest fans. He reminded Reed that he can have fans ejected, and offered as examples two players — McIlroy and Thomas — who have done so.
Reed thanked him but said he couldn’t have anyone ejected from the course. The problem with being golf’s perceived villain is ejecting the bad guy is bound to make things worse, not better. “It’s pretty much a no-win situation,” Reed said.
Can Reed contend this week, given all that he is contending with? What if he arrives on Sunday at the par-3 12th, with its hourglass green, to a swirling south wind lurking behind the trees and his estranged family behind the tee?
“What will I do?” Reed asked rhetorically. “What can I do? Nothing.”

SANYA, China — Officials at the Sanya Championship said Sunday that 28-year-old Malaysian golfer Arie Irawan died in his hotel room from "apparent natural causes," and the PGA Tour Series-China canceled the final round of the tournament.
The PGA Tour Series-China said in a statement that Irawan missed the 36-hole cut Friday in the tournament at Sanya Yalong Bay Golf Club. It said the official coroner's report had not been completed.
"The PGA Tour and the China Golf Association grieve at this loss of one of our members and share sincere condolences with Arie's wife, Marina, and his parents, Ahmad and Jeny," the tour said. "When something of this magnitude occurs in the golf world, we all grieve at the same time.
"Out of respect for the family, officials canceled the final round of the Sanya Championship, the tournament becoming a 54-hole event."
The PGA Tour China had an "In Memorium" photo of Irawan prominently displayed on its website Sunday.
American Trevor Sluman led after 54 holes with an 18-under total of 198. Three Americans — Matt Gilchrest, Max McGreevy and Michael Perras — were tied for second, two strokes behind.
Going into the tournament, Sluman, who finished ninth on the China Tour's 2018 Order of Merit, was seeking his first win in a four-day professional event since graduating from the University of Louisville in 2015.

Dustin Johnson shot his second consecutive bogey-free round to build a two-shot lead at 11-under-par 131 after two rounds of the Mexico Championship in Mexico City.
Trailing Rory McIlroy by one shot entering the second round, Johnson found himself four shots back after McIlroy birdied three of his first four holes. But Johnson, who had a putt for birdie on every hole, continued his steady play at Chapultepec Golf Club while McIlroy ran into midround trouble, finishing Friday in a tie for second at 9 under with Matt Kuchar (67).
Because McIlroy got into the clubhouse first with his 1-under 70 on Friday, he will be paired with Johnson in the final group on Saturday. Kuchar will be paired with Sergio García (66), who is tied for fourth place with Tommy Fleetwood at 7 under. Fleetwood tied for the low round of the day with his 65 despite missing a short putt on No. 17.
Ian Poulter (68) and Cameron Smith (67) are another shot off the pace. Tiger Woods was one shot off the low round of the day with his 66, which vaulted him 17 spots and into a five-tie for eighth place at 5 under.
No one had a bigger bounceback Friday than Phil Mickelson, the defending champion, who is tied for 39th. He moved up 31 spots by matching Fleetwood’s 65, and his 14-stroke improvement from the previous day was the largest single-round bounce-back in his 600 career PGA Tour events.
Johnson has not had any such turbulence through the first two days. While acknowledging Chapultepec had narrow fairways, he said the tree-lined holes kept him focused, and Johnson carded four birdies in posting a 67 on Friday.
He hit only half of the fairways in the second round, but he posted bogey-free rounds during the first two rounds of an event for the first time in his career.
“I think I have a very good game plan,” Johnson told reporters. “I don’t really play too aggressive here, but when you can, I try to be aggressive. And try to get myself some good looks at birdie, but off the tee, I can’t be too aggressive.”
Johnson has now been in the top 10 after nine of his past 10 rounds at the event, which is contested more than 7,000 feet above sea level and features many players hitting their long irons more than 300 yards.
“I just enjoy playing this kind of golf,” Johnson told the Golf Channel. “It makes you focus; you’ve got to think. You’re doing a lot of calculations with the numbers and trying to figure out how far the ball actually is going to go. I enjoy it.”
It looked early on as if McIlroy might run away and hide. He was 11 under when he took a rip at the green on the par-5 sixth hole with his second shot. But McIlroy’s ball found the water, and he wound up with a bogey.
He still held a one-shot lead when he stood over a birdie putt on the ninth hole. Having been perfect on all 24 putts inside 10 feet for the week to that point, McIlroy’s attempt lipped out. He also missed the comeback putt for bogey and suddenly found himself looking up at Johnson on the scoreboard.
McIlroy did birdie the 14th hole to get into that powerhouse final group on Saturday.
“We’ve still got 36 holes to go,” Johnson said. “I feel like I’m in a good position going into the weekend, but a two-shot lead is not very much, especially not around here.”
Woods fared much better in just his second professional round in Mexico, improving by five shots over his first-round score. That included a shot from a fairway bunker that sliced around a tree and came a foot or two from holing out.
“I realized that, ‘Jeez, I really gotta slice this thing,’ ” he told reporters. “So I opened up and gave it as much of a cut motion as I could, and it worked out.”

It began, in a very real sense, as an oasis in the desert.
When the first shots were struck at what was then the Karl Litten Desert Classic, Emirates Golf Club was flanked by little but sand. Aerial photos from the time showed a stark contrast between the club’s green fairways and various shades of brown outside its borders.
That was 30 years ago. Dubai, United Arab Emirates, was just starting to introduce itself as a tourist destination, and golf offered a natural fit with its winter sunshine and miles of undeveloped acreage. The European Tour was looking to expand and willing to take a chance.
The gamble worked. Enticed by Dubai’s world-class accommodations — and the occasional appearance fee — players quickly took notice. In time, the renamed Omega Dubai Desert Classic could boast about having more star power than whatever PGA Tour event it went up against.
Dubai’s success bred a second venture in the Middle East in 1998, the Qatar Masters. Abu Dhabi, another emirate, joined the schedule eight years later, and Dubai added a second event, the DP World Tour Championship, when the tour sought a big-finish season finale.
As the tour returns from its winter break, this week’s Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship presented by EGA is the first of six events set for the Middle East in 2019. That’s 12 percent of the European Tour’s schedule and some of its most attractive stops.
Abu Dhabi this year joins the Rolex Series, a collection of eight showcase events offering purses of at least $7 million. Brooks Koepka, the winner of last year’s United States Open and P.G.A. Championship, and Dustin Johnson will be among the challengers as Tommy Fleetwood seeks a third straight crown. In all, 15 of the top 50 in the world rankings are expected to play.
The tour shifts to Dubai a week later, where two of the past three Masters winners foreshadowed those victories by conquering Emirates Golf Club three months before. In all, on six occasions Dubai champions have won a major later that same year.
Qatar used to make up the third leg of what is called the desert swing, but with the addition of the NBO Oman Open last year and a tournament in Saudi Arabia this month, the tour has opted to break them into two clusters. The Saudi International powered by SBIA finishes the January swing; Oman and Qatar go back-to-back in March.
The DP World Tour Championship also is part of the Rolex Series, bringing the season to a close in November. In all, the six tournaments will hand out about $25 million in prize money.
“Across the board, our golfers love playing in the Middle East,” Keith Pelley, the European Tour’s chief executive, said when the Saudi International was announced last year. “They feel incredibly safe there, they are treated exceptionally well, and all of our host courses are terrific.”
The circuit’s Middle East success also empowered tour officials to continue pursuing territorial expansion, with tournaments now spread as far as South Africa, China, Malaysia and India.
Over time, the Middle East has hosted 64 European Tour events. Last year’s five stops in the region drew 22 players who began the year among the top 40 of the world rankings. Johnson ventured to Abu Dhabi for the second consecutive year; Matt Kuchar made his first visit to Abu Dhabi, and Pat Perez to Dubai.
“It’s a place I’ve always seen on TV, always kind of admired and wanted to see for myself,” Kuchar said upon arrival in Abu Dhabi.
“It’s always neat to pick up different things that you just don’t get from TV,” he added, “to actually put your hands on things and to see a different culture and see a different place.”
It was uncharted territory for everyone, from a golf standpoint, when Dubai made the pitch to bring a European Tour event there in 1989.
Emirates Golf Club had just opened; the Majlis course, in fact, was the first grassed golf course in the region. What little golf was played in the Middle East had been done on sand greens.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai who would later become prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, envisioned golf as a tourism driver. And the best way to sell the concept was to bring some of the world’s best golfers to play a tournament.
He found a willing ear in Ken Schofield, then the European Tour’s chief executive. For several years, Schofield had been looking for ways to expand the tour at a time when winter left much of Europe unable to partake in the sport.
The tour typically opened its season in April, after the Masters, either in Spain or Italy. There already had been one trial outside the Continent when the Tunisian Open started in 1982. That lasted four years; a Morocco tournament in 1987 didn’t last.
In that sense, the tour wasn’t averse to taking risks. But Dubai was so new to the sport that no one really had an idea what to expect.
Complicating matters was that Emirates Golf Club was then about 15 miles from Dubai’s outer limits. Players had first-class accommodations at the Intercontinental hotel, but almost nothing stood between the course and the city.
The course site was selected for its elevation and its natural terrain — one could see the Persian Gulf from the eighth green — but infrastructure was limited. The first edition had just one hospitality tent, two small grandstands and one scoreboard.
Nonetheless, an estimated 7,000 people, many of them European expatriates, came out to watch.
“It was like having a home game in the Middle East, only with perfect weather and the most magnificent course,” Phil Parkin, a golfer who is now an analyst,told The National, a newspaper based in Abu Dhabi, in 2015.
Mark James captured the inaugural, beating Peter O’Malley in a playoff.
The 1991 edition was not held because of the Persian Gulf war, but any concerns about the Desert Classic’s future disappeared the next year when Seve Ballesteros made it one of the final victories of his Hall of Fame career.
In 1994, Ernie Els scored his first European Tour win when he cruised to a six-shot romp in Dubai. Five months later, he stamped his name on a bigger stage by winning the U.S. Open at Oakmont.
Tiger Woods has teed it up seven times in Dubai, winning twice. He also helped create some of the event’s more famous images in 2004 when he struck shots from the Burj al Arab hotel’s helipad.
These days, the Dubai skyline is easily seen from the Emirates Golf Club fairways.
“It’s grown from a little unknown dune that nobody knew about back then to one of the tourist destinations of the world,” said Thomas Bjorn, last year’s winning European Ryder Cup captain, who made his Dubai debut in 1996.
Seeing Dubai’s success, the Qatar Masters made its debut in 1998 with Andrew Coltart taking home the trophy. Adam Scott has won it twice, as have Paul Lawrie and Branden Grace.
The Abu Dhabi Golf Championship came along in 2006, with five of the first six titles split between Martin Kaymer (three) and Paul Casey (two). The DP World Tour Championship began in 2009, with Rory McIlroy and Henrik Stenson each winning twice.
Even with the additions of Oman and Saudi Arabia, Pelley, the European Tour’s chief executive, hinted that the Middle East expansion may not be done. Bahrain was on the schedule for one year, hosting the short-lived Volvo Golf Champions in 2011 before the Arab Spring uprisings prompted organizers to move the 2012 event.
“To be honest, in the Middle East we’re open to hosting tournaments in any countries that want to support golf,” Pelley said. “At the moment we have six events, but could we feasibly have another one in there? I think so.”

AUGUSTA, Georgia — With the successful staging of the Augusta National Women's Amateur on Saturday, the home of the Masters removed a little more of the stain left by decades of gender discrimination.
But more polish will be needed if one of the world's most exclusive clubs hopes to clean the slate entirely.
"You are now part of history of Augusta National along with all the great Masters champions who have been right here in this Butler Cabin," said Augusta National chairman Fred Ridley as he presented the winner's trophy to Jennifer Kupcho.
The fact is, however, that women have long been a part of the history of Augusta National, albeit the dark chapter of exclusion.
Founded by Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts and opened for play in January 1933, Augusta National was a private sanctuary for some of the world's most powerful white men and for decades immune to outside influences and pressures.
Ron Townsend became the first African-American member in 1990 but it would be another two decades before women were admitted with former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and financier Darla Moore allowed through the doors in 2012.
While the pace remains glacial, change has nonetheless crept into the Augusta DNA.
Club membership is top secret but it is believed that four to six of the 300 or so members are women and have one of the iconic green jackets hanging in their lockers.
Augusta National also hosts the hugely popular Drive, Chip and Putt Championship for both boys and girls and has now put its name and branding muscle to a women's tournament.
The images of women competing at a club where they had previously been denied entry was a powerful one that was universally applauded.
Some, like activist Martha Burk, who in 2003 led a protest against Augusta National's men only policy, remain skeptical. She described the event as a "baby step" and "tokenism".
Certainly it was an emotional day for golfing greats Nancy Lopez, Pak Se-ri, Lorena Ochoa and Annika Sorenstam, who took part in a ceremonial tee shot then watched as 30 young women seized an opportunity that had never been open to them.
"When we were talking I was tearing up," said Lopez. "I was trying to hold back tears because there's so much pride involved in this.
"It was just a tremendous feeling to be there and represent amateur golf, professional golf and what golf stands for here at Augusta National."
"GREAT MOTIVATION"
There was no downplaying the significance of the moment for Lorena Ochoa, who compared it to golf being played at the Olympics.
"It's going to be a great motivation for the new generations," she said.
"This is as big as a tournament that you have in your mind -- the U.S. Amateur, or the Olympics -- that you dream that you want to win."
Without the Augusta National name attached to it, a tournament of this type would have been one watched by no more than a handful of family and friends.
Instead women's amateur golf on Saturday found itself in the sporting spotlight.
The final round was broadcast live on national television and a gallery worthy of a major tournament descended on the course to witness a bit of history.
While the golfing world was all but silent in 2003 when Burk was pushing for change, top men's players were squarely behind the women on Saturday.
Masters champion Bubba Watson, wearing his green jacket, watched from the first tee, while others like Rory McIlroy and Jack Nicklaus offered support on social media.
While Augusta has put its name to the tournament, only one round was played at the iconic course and the question remains as to what happens next for women's golf and Augusta National.
"This is an historic moment, and hopefully they will continue to carry the torch, and who knows what opportunities will come 10, 15 years from now," said Sorenstam. "This is just the beginning.
"We are trying to increase the interest in the game of golf, and tournaments like this will certainly do it.
"I've never seen so much exposure for a tournament, and to see these girls come up here and step it up and have so much fun and enjoy it, I mean, this is a dream come true."

PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. — Rory McIlroy’s Sunday drive at TPC Sawgrass was far from leisurely. He spent most of the final round of the Players Championship stuck in his lane in a logjam, pumping his brakes while players grew larger in his rearview mirror.
Eddie Pepperell, who started Sunday six strokes behind McIlroy, caught him, and so, fleetingly, did Jhonattan Vegas, who also began the round six behind him. Early on, McIlroy, who himself began the day trailing Jon Rahm by one, was passed on the leader board by Abraham Ancer, who came from three off his pace. Down the stretch, Jim Furyk, who came from four back, inched ahead.
In contrast to last year, when Webb Simpson squeezed all the drama from the finish with a four-stroke victory, Sunday was a knock-down-drag-out race to the wire, with eight players holding at least a share of the lead — including Vegas for 16 seconds — before McIlroy took command.
McIlroy did not panic when he carded a double bogey on the fourth hole and made the turn in a one-over-par 37. While everyone around him spun out or ran out of road, McIlroy put together four birdies, against one bogey, on the back nine for a final-round two-under 70, good for a one-stroke victory.
McIlroy, of Northern Ireland, finished at 16-under 272, one ahead of Furyk, who closed with a 67, and two in front of Pepperell (66) and Vegas (66). Rahm struggled to a 76 and ended up in a four-way tie for 12th at 11 under.
The victory was McIlroy’s 15th on the PGA Tour, and his second in two years on St. Patrick’s Day weekend.
“It’s not a bad weekend for me,” said McIlroy, who lifted his long-sleeve blue sweater to reveal, along with an impish grin, a green golf shirt.
McIlroy showed little emotion after he two-putted for par on the last hole to close out the tournament in brisk, overcast and intermittently rainy conditions. His emotions, by design, have run the gamut from happy to content during each top-six finish in his first six starts of 2019.
“Of course I desperately wanted the win today, but it’s just another day,” McIlroy said. “It’s just another step in the journey.”
A decade has passed since McIlroy made his first start at Sawgrass, on the week that he turned 20. As he recalled with a laugh, he missed the cut that year while “getting kicked out of bars in Jax Beach for being underage. So I’ve come a long way.”
But his transformation has been deeper than that. McIlroy said he had learned not to tie his self-identity to his scores.
“One thing I used to do in the past is I’d let what I shot that day influence who I was or my mood,” McIlroy said, adding, “It’s something I’ve worked hard on because who I am as a person isn’t who I am as a golfer.”
That TPC Sawgrass, in its return to March after an 12-year run in May, provided a fair test was made plain in the juxtaposition at the top of the long-hitting 29-year-old, McIlroy, and the length-challenged 48-year-old, Furyk.
Furyk, who lives a short drive from the course, was one of the last players to earn his way into the field, and though he came up short in his bid for his first tour title since 2015, he had few complaints; the runner-up finish was his best showing in 23 starts in the event.
“I haven’t put myself in the heat with a really good opportunity to win a golf tournament in a while and I missed it,” Furyk said. “I missed the nerves, I missed the excitement.”
McIlroy, the world No. 6, played in the next-to-last pairing, which was his first big break. He has fallen short of the winner’s circle the past nine times that he has appeared in the final Sunday grouping.
How tough is it to be the hunted on Sunday? Rahm and Tommy Fleetwood (73), who played directly behind McIlroy and Jason Day (72), were the only players in the top 15 who failed to at least equal par.
McIlroy has one more start — the World Golf Championships match-play event in two weeks — before he tries for the fifth time to complete a career Grand Slam with a victory at the Masters.
If he took anything away from Sunday, besides the gold trophy, McIlroy said it was an affirmation that he was on the right track.
“I feel like I’ve managed the first six weeks or six tournaments of the year very well, even with some noise around me, whether it is he can’t close, he can’t play on Sundays, blah, blah, blah,” McIlroy said. “I’ve just got to do my thing, and if I go and I concentrate on me, control what I can do, good golf and good attitude takes care of the rest.”

The not-quite-ready-for-prime-time Thanksgiving exhibition with Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson produced such bad golf that Mickelson and country singer Jake Owen traded barbs about it a day later at Jordan Spieth's wedding.
Owen said it was so bad he deserved a refund. He told Barstool Sports' "Fore Play" podcast that Mickelson, who won $9 million from the TV spectacle, pulled out a wad of $100 bills, handed one to Owen and told him he had 90,000 more where that came from.
Golf's two biggest attractions are back at the Masters, eager to play the kind of golf this week that they couldn't produce in The Match. The two 40-somethings will be on prominent display, though the trash talk that was promised on the pay-per-view money grab will not be heard on the hallowed grounds of Augusta National.
And, unlike The Match, the Masters will deliver.
It always has, with moments like Woods stunning the field in a runaway victory at the age of 21, or Mickelson leaping for joy on the 18th green after finally winning his first major in 2004.
It always has, even when an unknown like Danny Willett came from nowhere to win, only to quickly disappear from the golf landscape.
And it even did last year when Patrick Reed won a green jacket that few in the Sunday crowd seemed particularly happy about.
The Masters enjoys special status as the enduring annual rite of spring, the place every duffer who has ever picked up a club dreams of hitting shots. Set under magnificently manicured fairways and greens and framed by towering pines, it offers a tantalizing glimpse of summer in a place where nothing seems to change but something is different every year.
Arnold Palmer won there four times and Jack Nicklaus six. Woods has four green jackets, and Mickelson has three.
Still, the defending champion is rarely the focus and for the most part the big names in the game aren't either. The course is the star, even when the real tournament begins — as is Masters lore — on the back nine on Sunday.
That's true more than ever this year, even as spectators and television viewers got a rare sneak preview of Augusta National on Saturday for the first time with the final round of a women's amateur tournament.
Reed comes in mired in a deep slump that had him seeking the aid of swing coach David Leadbetter last month, at the insistence of his wife. Bookies in Las Vegas make him a 40-1 pick, long odds for someone trying to become the fourth player to repeat as Masters champion.
Still, Reed said last month he was looking forward to everything about the Masters, except the fact he will have to turn in his green jacket if he's not successful in repeating.
"You want to keep it around as long as you can," Reed said of the famous jacket. "The only way you're going to do that is continue winning at Augusta and continue winning the event so you can have it year in and year out."
History suggests that won't be happening, since only three players before Reed have returned to successfully defend their title. But there is golf to be played before that's decided, and a champion's dinner to be eaten.
Reed said at The Player's Championship that he figured out the menu for the dinner long before he won.
"Oh, I knew that back when I was 13," he said. "I mean, it was always a bone-in ribeye, mac and cheese, creamed corn, creamed spinach. I'm going to fatten those boys up a little bit."
Reed didn't exactly bask in the love of the galleries last year when he rolled in a 3-footer on the 18th green to beat Rickie Fowler by a shot and Spieth by two. The stories that followed didn't make him any easier to root for, when he declined to discuss why his parents weren't welcomed at the tournament despite living just a few miles away.
Mickelson and Woods, meanwhile, have had their own personal issues, though that hasn't dented their popularity. The two are icons of modern golf, and even in their 40s they are among the group of favorites that include Fowler, Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Dustin Johnson.
Just don't expect Mickelson to do what he did at the U.S. Open last year and run after a putt and hit it while it's still moving. Do that at Augusta National and you'd get a one-way trip back out Magnolia Lane, and no invitation in the mail the next spring.
Don't expect Mickelson or Woods to play as badly as they did in their pay-per-view match, either. Both know every inch of grass on Augusta National, both know how to hit miracle shots when it really matters and both have lots of experience in putting the green jacket on.
Then again, Woods hasn't won a Masters in 14 years, and Mickelson is almost a decade removed from his last green jacket. They're legends on a legendary golf course, but there are probably 20 younger players who can beat them when playing their best.
Mickelson and Woods sold their Thanksgiving match with a promise of riveting golf and even better TV.
No need to sell this. It's the Masters, and it's as real as golf gets.

RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. — Let other players take dead aim at titles and trophies. Jin Young Ko is finding success by directing her focus elsewhere.
“I want to be the happiest player on the golf course,” Ko said.
Ko, the latest star in South Korea’s bright constellation, burst into tears Sunday after closing with a two-under-par 70 to win the ANA Inspiration. It was her second L.P.G.A. title in less than a month and her first major championship.
Ko, who posted a 72-hole total of 10-under 278, finished three strokes ahead of her compatriot Mi Hyang Lee, who carded a final-round 70. Lexi Thompson, a former champion, shot a 67 for third, four strokes back.
For Ko, 23, happiness was a 15-foot birdie putt on the 72nd hole, after which she collapsed into the embrace of her caddie, David Brooker, who has guided three players to this championship.
“We are a really good team,” Ko said.
Ko capped her win by leaping into Poppie’s Pond with Brooker by her side.
Brooker said he was approached last year by an intermediary sent to gauge his interest in caddying for Ko. Brooker had worked with golfers who had played competitive rounds with her, so he had seen Ko’s game up close and was impressed with her driving accuracy and self-possession.
But he had an agreement to work for Paula Creamer, a 12-time winner worldwide, through the end of last season, her 14th as a professional. At the end of 2018, after Ko was named the L.P.G.A.’s top rookie, Brooker made the switch.
In her first six starts with Brooker on her bag, Ko has five top-3 finishes, including two victories. Her final-round scoring average is 66.83 strokes. It is a tossup as to who is the hottest player on the planet: Ko or the men’s world No. 3, Rory McIlroy, who has seven top-9 finishes, including one victory, in seven starts in 2019.
The 23-year-old Ko could not have asked for a more capable Sherpa than Brooker to help her plant her name at the top of the ANA Inspiration leader board. He entered the week having made 16 caddie appearances since 1997 at Mission Hills Country Club and two celebratory leaps into Poppie’s Pond, with Grace Park in 2004 and Lorena Ochoa in 2008.
Brooker knows the greens like his backyard, which is why Ko trusted him to read many of her putts.
“He helps me all the time on the green or the fairways,” she said.
Brooker’s guidance can be more subtle. After Ko played in the afternoon Friday and signed for a 71, she said she wanted to spend what little daylight remained working on her swing. Brooker talked her out of it, explaining that the gusting wind would make any range work counterproductive.
He suggested that she spend the time instead on her main area of emphasis during the off-season: chipping and putting.
“We are really good team,” Ko said.
Ko has four L.P.G.A. titles — and 14 over all — since she turned pro in 2013. Before earning her L.P.G.A. membership, Ko starred on the Korean L.P.G.A. tour. She was playing on her homeland circuit in 2015 when she took a three-stroke lead into the final round of her first major start, the Women’s British Open.
Ko, then 19, finished second to her compatriot Inbee Park.
And though that runner-up finish offered validation that her game stacked up well against the best, she said last year that she was hesitant to jump headlong to the L.P.G.A.
Before a tournament in Seoul last October, Ko said she engaged in considerable “soul searching” before she decided to leave home to compete on the American-based tour. Unlike many of her countrywomen, Ko does not maintain a residence in the United States.
“She doesn’t want a base over here,” Brooker said.
Ko’s homing instincts remind him of Ochoa, who was the women’s world No. 1 when she retired at 28 because she could no longer bear to be apart from her family and away from her native Mexico for long stretches.
“I don’t think she’s going to have one of those 20-year careers,” Brooker said. “I could see her playing out here five or six years and then retiring to have a family. She is not motivated by money, she’s not motivated by titles. She just wants to have fun.”
Ko can find the hilarity in courting disaster. On Saturday, she began the day four strokes off the lead, raced to a five-stroke advantage after 10 holes, then gave most of it back with a double bogey at No. 14 and a bogey at No. 15. After she used a pitching wedge to hit her tee shot into the water at the par-3 14th, Ko playfully rested her head on Brooker’s shoulder, sighed and said, “Oh, what have I done?”
Her third-round wobble proved instructive for Ko, who kept calm when she smelled the whiff of disaster on her back nine Sunday. After bogeys on the 13th and 15th holes whittled her lead over Lee to a single stroke, Ko rebounded with a birdie on the par-3 16th to give herself breathing room.
“She is just so smart for her age,” Brooker, said. “She knows what she’s doing out there.”

Minimizing manicured grass isn’t the first thing that comes to mind when you think of improvements to a high-end golf course.
But Sailfish Point Golf Club on Hutchinson Island on Florida’s east coast, did just that. Now, butterflies have moved in where native grasses and flowers have been allowed to grow tall.
Across the state, on Sanibel Island, the Sanctuary Golf Club ripped out concrete cart paths and brought in beehives to help pollinate the local wildflowers.
In Skidaway, Ga., near Savannah, the Landings Club dug a new irrigation system to lower water consumption, and it built nesting areas for a native terrapin rescue program.
Golf courses and environmental initiatives haven’t always coexisted. But today, many course superintendents — the men and women who plan and maintain courses — hope to reshape that thinking.
Sustainability efforts are often “motivated by economics,” said Max Adler, the editorial director of Golf Digest. “The whole industry is seeing a correction away from the very manicured, overmanufactured look of golf—and at the same time what really motivates golf courses to pursue that look is the bottom line. The less water you use, the less grass grows, the less maintenance you have to cover.”
In the last 10 years, he said, many clubs have replaced manicured areas of their courses “with sand, with native floras and shrubs that exist naturally on the topography and just leave it. And it looks beautiful.”
“If you’re doing things that are economically sound, it’s often in line with what you are doing environmentally,” said James Murphy, an extension specialist in turf management at Rutgers University in New Jersey.
Players and residents also are demanding more eco-friendly practices.
“It’s very important to people now that the community they live in respects the environment and takes care of it,” said Kristen Cheskaty, a broker and a managing partner at Sailfish Point Realty in Stuart, Fla.
Because of that, golf communities in the United States and elsewhere in the world are focusing on things as varied as eliminating plastic and foam cups in their snack shops and reducing fertilizers and chemicals in the upkeep of the fairways.
“All the little things add up,” Mr. Adler said. “Even though it’s a small footprint for the day, over the course of the season it’s real. More importantly it sends a message to people’s minds that we want to be thoughtful and sensitive to the environment.”
Florida’s Sailfish Point has followed guidelines created by a not-for-profit environmental education organization called Audubon International, which offers a certification program for good golf-course management practices.
Sailfish Point — a private 532-acre waterfront development with 520 low-rise homes, condominiums and townhouses — is bordered on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, the Fort Pierce Inlet to the north, and the Indian River Lagoon to the west.
But in recent years, the lagoon has suffered from extensive algae blooms that most experts believe are related to discharge from Lake Okeechobeee, which is surrounded by farmland and polluted by fertilizer runoff.
Scott MacPhee, the director of golf course operations at Sailfish Point, said many residents were concerned about any role the golf course could play in contributing to such pollution.
“A lot of fingers could easily be pointed at our community and our operation, and I didn’t want that for our members,” Mr. MacPhee said. “Whether the blame is on golf courses, farms or septic tanks, ultimately, we all want to do the right thing and we all want clean water.”
More than 800 golf courses in the United States and 2,100 courses in 34 countries have been certified by Audubon International.
At Sailfish Point, earning the certificate took about two years. The work began in 2016 and included an environmental assessment and developing a wildlife and habitat management plan; reducing chemical use; and stepping up water conservation. In some areas, the golf course staff planted vegetation buffer zones, allowing growth of mangrove trees and aquatic plants to form a barrier between the golf course and waterways.
Mark Perry, the executive director at the Florida Oceanographic Society in Stuart, who has consulted with the staff at Sailfish Point, said that the development’s buffer zones are “good common practice to let the shoreline vegetation help absorb nutrients” that can be damaging to the environment.
Although Audubon International began the certification program around 30 years ago, a degree of confusion still exists about its relationship with the 114-year-old National Audubon Society, a nonprofit conservation group with the mission “to protect birds and the places they need, today and tomorrow.” The two are separate, unrelated entities.
In Georgia, Chris Steigelman, who oversees three of the six Audubon International-certified golf courses at the Landings, said the certification process included installing a more drought-tolerant turf grass with a deeper root zone and a more effective irrigation system, which cost more than $10 million. Those steps have enabled the Landings to reduce water use by nearly 40 percent on its courses, he said.
The Landings, situated within tidal salt marshes and the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, is also popular with native Diamondback Terrapins, which had a risky habit of depositing their eggs in golf course bunkers.
Carolyn McInerney, a local real estate agent who lives at the Landings, began the Diamondback Terrapin Rescue Project by placing the eggs in little flower pots on her back porch.
“Now, we have five different nest boxes built around the golf course with community signs telling people about the program, as well as terrapin hatchling release parties,” Mr. Steigelman said. “It’s become a big community project.”
In addition to the terrapin nests, the Landings has a system of bluebird boxes installed throughout its courses, monitored by community volunteers; pollinator gardens with native plantings for bees and butterflies; and a bird-cam to monitor owl, eagle and osprey nesting.
“People are looking for quality of life and that truly sells the island,” Ms. McInerney said. “More and more people are interested in nature.”
Meredith Welch moved to Skidaway Island in 2008 after working for 20 years in New York City. She said she had been attracted to a place where she could be outdoors all year
“When I became a resident here, I couldn’t believe I could sit in my backyard and watch hawks, fox, deer and an amazing parade of animals walk through because there are no fences between neighbors,” she said.
After seeing the benefits of certification for the golf courses at the Landing, Ms. Welch helped start an effort to get Audubon certification for the city’s residential section, a process that took five years.
“We have a right to clean water and clean air,” Ms. Welch said. “And we can learn that we should protect things that are fragile and precious.”
In southwest Florida, the Sanctuary stands out for its location.
The community and its course, which has been certified by Audubon International, are surrounded by the 6,300-acre J.N. Ding Darling National Wildlife Refuge — home to more than 300 species of birds, 50 species of reptiles and more than 30 mammal species. Two-thirds of the island is protected land.
“If you’re going to be buying real estate on Sanibel Island, you’ve already bought into the environmental side of things and you probably already get it,” said Kyle Sweet, the superintendent at the Sanctuary Golf Club, the island’s only private course.
Mr. Sweet not only maintains his course to Audubon International standards, but he also is guided by the wildlife refuge, as well as by rigid city requirements. Water quality and chemical nutrient loads are regularly monitored and the city issues an annual grade.
Even residences are regulated in regard to impermeable surfaces, such as driveways. The Sanctuary has removed more than a mile and a half of concrete cart paths from the course.
The course has also converted to hardier, salt-tolerant turf grass and upgraded its irrigation system for a 30 percent savings in water use.
“We have a lot of members who are on the board at the Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation and Ding Darling National Wildlife Refuge,” said Kathryn Riggio, the membership coordinator at the Sanctuary. “They are very invested in our environmental responsibility.”
After Dr. Wendy Kindig, a Sanctuary resident and golf club member, retired from her clinical nephrology practice, she got involved in enviromental efforts at the Sanctuary, as well as on the board of the “Ding” Darling Wildlife Society.
“Conservation is pretty ingrained in this community,” she said.

This week, we have a special treat:Karen Crouse, one of our sportswriters who was here for the Australian Open, spent time with Briony Lyle, the wife of Jarrod Lyle, one of Australia’s most beloved golfers, who died of cancer a few months ago.
He was only 36. Here’s hisNew York Times obituaryif you missed it.
We’ve turned the newsletter over to Karen and Briony, for insights on sport and life. Tell us what you think atnytaustralia@nytimes.com.
___
Briony Lyle laughs when she thinks about it now, but in the days after her husband, Jarrod, died following a lengthy battle with leukemia, she wondered what she would do with herself. For nearly a decade, her days had revolved around Jarrod’s schedule, first as a professional golfer and, later as a second-and-third-time cancer patient.
Jarrod’s death last August at age 36 unleasheda global outpouring of emotion and supportfrom people whose lives he touched or who were touched by the story of a seemingly regular bloke who had absorbed life’s — and golf’s — bad breaks with grit and good cheer.
At the time I marveled at how a group of athletes who tend to measure success so rigidly, who generally buy into the belief that they are what their scores say they are, rallied to give a farewell befitting a giant to Jarrod, a journeyman whose highest finish in 121 P.G.A. Tour starts was a tie for fourth.
Curious to know what life was like for Briony after the elegies stopped, I followed the Australia Day migration of beachgoers to Torquay, the gateway to the Great Ocean Road, where Briony and Jarrod moved in 2012 and where, she said, Jarrod peacefully passed his final days.
The half-year anniversary of Jarrod’s death was upon her, but that’s not why Briony saw reminders of her husband everywhere.
The day before, an American, Bryson DeChambeau, had claimed a seven-stroke victory at the Dubai Desert Classic, a European Tour event. Briony has never met the 25-year-old DeChambeau, but at the P.G.A. Championship, held the week after Jarrod’s death, DeChambeau won a long-driving contest and donated the $25,000 winner’s check to an education fund set up for the Lyles’s young daughters, Lusi, 6, and Jemma, 2.
Since then, Briony, who never really cared for golf, has been a huge fan of DeChambeau. She recently sent him a thank-you note, which began the same as hundreds of others that she had written over the past few months: “We may never meet, but what you did was so amazing, just to say thank you is not enough.”
This week in the United States, the P.G.A. Tour is outside Phoenix, for a tournament known for its party atmosphere, huge crowds and stadium-style 16th hole.
The par 3 has been the scene of nine aces, including one by Tiger Woods and another by Jarrod in what was perhaps the signature moment of his P.G.A. Tour career.
It happened during the second round of the 2011 event, and Jarrod’s reaction was almost as memorable as a result. While the shot was airborne, he made the motion to sit with both hands as if his golf ball were a puppy at obedience school. After the ball bounced on the green and rolled in the cup, he pumped his arms multiple times, then windmilled his arms to churn the already raucous crowd of more than 25,000 into even more of a lather.
Smiling ear to ear, he ran over to his caddie shouting, “You beauty,” only, in typical Jarrod fashion, with an expletive added for emphasis.
Briony said Jarrod replayed the video of the shot and his reaction hundreds of times over the years.
“He’d tell people not to believe all the views it has gotten because he’s been responsible for most of them,” she said. “People thought he was just being humble, but he was telling the truth.”
She laughed.
“He watched that video all the time. I can remember waking up to him giggling and I’d ask him what he was laughing at and he’d say, ‘I just watched the hole-in-one again.’”
Golf did not captivate Briony, who was a high school classmate of Jarrod’s in their hometown, Shepparton, in northern Victoria. When they started dating a few years later, she attended his tournaments but recognized early on that she was going to need a diversion.
“I couldn’t possibly spend my time walking aimlessly around golf courses pretending I was invested in every shot and every moment,” said Briony, who enrolled in classes in Melbourne to become a massage therapist. She accumulated her required training hours, she said, by setting up a massage table at tournaments and kneading the muscles of the caddies.
She earned her certification in 2012, shortly before giving birth to the couple’s first daughter, Lusi. Another daughter, Jemma, arrived four years later. Around the time of Lusi’s birth, Jarrod learned that the leukemia he had battled successfully in high school had returned.
He was off the P.G.A. Tour for more than two years,then came back and made 20 more starts. He had returned to Australia to play his home tour and try his hand at broadcasting when he found out in late 2017 that the leukemia had returned a third time.
During his initial battle with the disease, Jarrod became acquainted with Challenge, a nonprofit dedicated to providing practical and personalized services to the families of cancer patients. The organization’s mascot isa duck named Leuk, and since Jarrod’s death people from all over the world have snatched up Leuk merchandise, everything from duck head covers to pins and ball markers.
Next week top performers from the P.G.A. Tour of Australasia, the Australian Ladies Professional Golf, the European Tour and the Ladies European Tour will converge on Barwon Heads Golf Club, not far from Torquay, for the Vic Open. Briony will be there, selling Leuk the Duck merchandise to raise money for families dealing with cancer.
“I have my moments — many, many moments — mostly nighttime where I can’t sleep because of things playing over in my mind,” Briony said. “But I’m able to grab on to this incredible thing that came out of what happened, there’s so much good that came out of it and I’m just so determined to draw attention to this cause because I’m not unique, unfortunately.”
A bittersweet thing happened; she lost her golfer husband and found a calling that drew her deeper into golf.
“After he died, I kept telling people over and over, my life tended to revolve around Jarrod either in illness or career and now my life continues to revolve around him,” she said. “That’s the legacy.”

Sarsfield, AUSTRALIA — Greg Carter really likes to golf. The Australian Vietnam War veteran enjoys it so much that one day in 2006, his wife Anne suggested that he put a hole in the yard of their sprawling 52-acre property.
“When I got over there, I looked across the valley and thought, gee whiz, I could put another one on that little hill,” he recalled, while giving a tour of the grounds recently. He mowed the grass and put in a few more holes, he said.
Thirteen years later, the result is a private golf course set in hilly farmland in the southeastern state of Victoria, about a three-and-a-half-hour drive from Melbourne.
But the meaning of the property to the Carters goes beyond the sport of golf. Since the course was built, the couple has opened up the grounds to Australian war veterans and their families to use as a cost-free retreat.
Mr. Carter was deployed in Vietnam for 12 months in 1969, and the idea for a retreat came to him after he realized the abrupt transition that many war veterans faced after returning home. For those reluctant to seek out government support or clubs, he said, there were few resources. While mapping out the course, Mr. Carter thought that the property, with its nature-steeped solitude, could offer veterans a place to feel safe, secure and away from the public.
Hundreds have used the retreat over the years, the Carters said, as a place to connect with others who understand what they’ve been through. For civilians who have not been to war, Mr. Carter said, the psychological impact of military service is difficult to understand.
After Mr. Carter opened the retreat, named Cockatoo Rise, and alerted veterans’ organizations, “the word got around reasonably quickly,” he said.
The property includes a 42-square-meter, or roughly 450-square-foot, home, six fenced paddocks, a large shed, a garden and an outdoor barbecue area.
But the Carters are approaching their 70s and looking to sell. They have put the entire property, which includes a four-bedroom, two-bath house, on the market. “For somebody who’s retired, this would be the dream,” Mr. Carter said. “They can make their rules up and their own dress code.”
The asking price is 1.79 million Australian dollars, or about $1.27 million.
In recent years, the housing market has boomed in nearby Bairnsdale, real estate agents said, with interest from investors from cities like Melbourne and Sydney. But only a few properties in the area sell for over 1 million Australian dollars, putting the Carters’ home on the very high end of the market, said Ross Tucker, a sales consultant at LJ Hooker Bairnsdale. In the last seven years, Mr. Tucker said, two nearby properties have sold for more than 1 million dollars: a colonial mansion on five acres on a river and an architecturally distinctive house set on two acres.
In Bairnsdale, the average price for a three-bedroom home is about 300,000 dollars, Mr. Tucker said. The price of farmland is more varied: land with rich soils used for agriculture can sell for about 12,000 dollars an acre and bushland for as little as 2,000 dollars an acre.
Property values also come down to location, said Sean Sabell, a director at Elders Real Estate Bairnsdale, with some buyers willing to pay more for water and mountain views.
Originally, Mr. Carter laid out an 18-hole course, but he eventually scaled it back to nine.
It took about six years for it to come together. Mr. Carter mowed fairways and planted gum, lilly pilly and protea trees. A line of pines traces one fairway, though such trees are rare on Australian golf courses because their root systems can grow into fairways and disturb the game, Mr. Carter said.
Water from a dam on the property is used to water the greens. In recent months, to conserve water during an especially dry Australian summer, nine tee boxes have been set up around four holes, allowing for abbreviated play.
The main house, built when the Carters arrived 15 years ago, has an open-plan design, with high ceilings and sliding-glass windows to let in the light.
The building’s main draw is an outdoor dining area facing south, with a 300-degree view overlooking the undulating landscape to the nearby waters of the Gippsland Lakes and to the mountains in the west. Often, visiting veterans will sit there alongside a rock-bordered pond and its goldfish.
Because the Carters regularly throw parties for friends, they make heavy use of their 60-foot-long (18-meter) living room, which includes a fireplace and an indoor pond.
The surrounding Gippsland Lakes region includes parks, bushland and some of the country’s largest waterways. Bairnsdale, a town ofabout 15,000 people, is minutes from the property and the local community is close-knit.
Currently, the shed houses a museum, where Mr. Carter displays a vast collection of wartime relics, including uniforms, replicas of mines and ration packs. The museum will move with them when they leave. “We haven’t set this up to relive the war,” Mr. Carter said. “It’s a teaching ground.”
Some of the veterans the Carters have hosted are homeless or struggle with mental health issues. One Afghanistan veteran called Mr. Carter, despondent, after 19 fellow servicemen had committed suicide. “He had hit rock bottom,” Mr. Carter said, wiping away tears.
On most evenings, the Carters keep a campfire burning on a corner of their property. Sometimes, the veterans who gather there are silent. But other times, lulled by the fire and the nature around them, they start talking about what they remember.
John Cottom, a Vietnam veteran who visited the retreat in February, said he has found that psychiatrists can be intimidating to talk to about wartime experiences. Apart from the Carters, the best part of the Cockatoo Rise retreat, he said, is meeting other veterans.
“You can sit down and talk and you don’t have to explain things” said Mr. Cottom, who is 71. “You relax and let some things out.”
Although he hasn’t met anyone he served with, he said, “It’s like we know each other. It’s a special friendship.”
The wives of veterans, he added, are made very welcome, too. “The women are often overlooked, but they’ve gone through hell, too, putting up with us,” Mr. Cottom said.
Frank Hoy, 70 and a veteran of the Royal Australian Navy, first visited the retreat from his home in Melbourne four years ago and has returned several times. “We sit around the fire and solve the problems of the world,” Mr. Hoy said.
Several real estate agents in the area expressed skepticism that the Carters could achieve their asking price, but the couple said that they have done their research and are not fazed.
At dusk, native birds and other wildlife emerge from hiding. After Mr. Carter’s tour, several cockatoos alighted on a eucalyptus tree by the kitchen window. A few eastern grey kangaroos appeared and nibbled the grass.
“We’ve got a really old boy that comes through every night,” Anne Carter said, adding that sightings of echidnas — also known as spiny anteaters — and wombats are also common.
“It’ll be a disappointment for Anne and I to leave here,” Mr. Carter said as a kangaroo peered into the house. The Carters plan to take the Cockatoo Rise name with them to their next home but hope the property’s next owners will consider keeping it accessible to veterans. “We’d be delighted if they did that. Absolutely delighted,” Mr. Carter said.

An undocumented immigrant who worked at one of President Trump’s golf clubs in New Jersey for years and recently spoke out about her experience will attend his State of the Union address after being invited by her Democratic congresswoman, the woman’s lawyer and the congresswoman’s office said Wednesday.
The undocumented immigrant, Victorina Morales, had worked as a housekeeper at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., since 2013, and spoke to The New York Times aspart of an article published last month. The report revealed that the president’s company — the Trump Organization — was, for years, employing people at the golf club who are in the country illegally.
In a brief interview on Wednesday, Ms. Morales said that on the advice of her lawyer, she stopped going to work on Dec. 4, two days before the Times article was published. Still, the lawyer, Anibal Romero, said that neither he nor his client had received notice that she had been fired. He said Ms. Morales’s employment status with the golf club was not entirely clear.
Since leaving her job, Ms. Morales, who is from Guatemala, has campaigned for rights and fair treatment for undocumented immigrants. On Wednesday, she said she was pleased to have been invited tothe State of the Union, that she has accepted the invitation and that she was “very proud because I am going to raise my voice for all of us immigrants.”
“I’m not scared to show my face,” she said, speaking in Spanish. “I am not speaking for me, I’m speaking on behalf of millions of undocumented immigrants who live in the United States.”
The congresswoman, Bonnie Watson Coleman, represents the New Jersey district in which Ms. Morales lives. The news that Ms. Morales had been invited to attend Tuesday’s State of the Union address as Ms. Watson Coleman’s guest was reported byThe Washington Poston Wednesday.
“Immigrants by and large are hardworking, trustworthy and skilled people who simply want to work and build better lives here,” Ms. Watson Coleman said in a statement. “For years these kinds of people were loyal and dedicated enough to be Trump Organization employees. I hope that in his State of the Union address, Donald Trump will finally acknowledge the real face of immigrants in this country — women and children fleeing violence; law-abiding, taxpaying people who would do almost anything to be Americans. And if he can’t, I’ve invited Victorina so that he may look her in her eyes to tell his lies to a familiar face.”
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday evening.
Mr. Trump has made border security and protecting jobs for Americans cornerstones of his presidency, and his insistence on building a border wall led to the recent partial government shutdown. He has labeled illegal immigration “a major, major problem,” and pledged to build a border wall while his administration has carried out workplace raids and payroll audits.
The Times article, published Dec. 6, said undocumented immigrants had been employed for years at the Trump National Golf Club as housekeepers, landscapers and kitchen staff. It also said they were kept on the payroll even though management was aware they had used phony documents to secure employment, as is common among undocumented immigrants.
Ms. Morales previously told The Times that a manager at Bedminster had helped her secure a new fake Social Security number and legal permanent-residency card after telling her that those on file had expired.
Since the article was published, about a dozen workers deemed ineligible to work in the United States because they lacked legal immigration status have been terminated at the Bedminster club, according to people familiar with the matter.
Another dozen were fired at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County, N.Y.,this month, a development first reportedby The Washington Post.
The Trump Organization also said late Tuesday that it wasputting in place a system to weed out undocumented immigrants who try to get jobsat its properties.
“I must say, for me personally, this whole thing is truly heartbreaking,” Eric Trump, an executive vice president with the Trump Organization, said in the statement on Tuesday. “Our employees are like family, but when presented with fake documents, an employer has little choice.”
He said that hiring undocumented immigrants was not a problem unique to the Trump Organization, and that it “demonstrates that our immigration system is severely broken and needs to be fixed immediately.”

Golf Roundup
ByThe Associated Press
Seven years after missing a 1-foot putt on the final hole of regulation and losing a playoff, In-Kyung Kim was back on top at the ANA Inspiration.
Kim, a 30-year-old South Korean, shot a seven-under-par 65 in mostly calm morning conditions on Friday at Mission Hills in Rancho Mirage, Calif., to take a three-stroke second-round lead over Katherine Kirk in the first L.P.G.A. major of the year.
“Every stage, every passage of life has meaning to it and serves some purpose to it,” Kim said. “I’m just here doing my best.”
In 2012, Kim missed the short par putt to fall into a playoff and lost when Sun Young Yoo birdied the first extra hole. Kim struggled with the loss before finally ending a long victory drought late in the 2016 season in China. Her confidence renewed, she won three times the next year, capped by a major victory in the Women’s British Open.
“Sometimes winning is great, but for me as an athlete, you want to see some progress in your game,” Kim said. “That’s what I’m focusing on at the moment. That gives me joy. Anything else really is just a bonus, an extra.”
On Friday on the tree-lined layout toughened by thick, dewy rough, tighter fairways and some longer holes, Kim birdied all four of the par-5 holes and played a nine-hole stretch in the middle of the round in six under. After three-putting the par-4 seventh for her first bogey in 25 holes, she saved par on the par-3 eighth with an 8-footer and closed the round with an 8-foot birdie putt on the par-4 ninth to reach eight-under 136.
“I had makable putts that went in,” Kim said. “Yesterday, I also had a lot of opportunities, but in the afternoon, when the wind blows on the back nine, you can’t really be too aggressive to the flag.”
Kirk, a 37-year-old Australian, bogeyed the final two holes in a 68.
“I think my best golf is still ahead of me, which is nice to say at 37,” said Kirk, who won the last of her three tour titles in 2014. “All the experience, too, that I have had, I can use to that my advantage or at least try to use it to my advantage.”
Ally McDonald, the first-round leader, and Jin Young Ko were four strokes back. Lexi Thompson, the 2014 champion, shot 72, leaving her five strokes back with top-ranked Sung Hyun Park (70), Charley Hull (69), Jing Yan (71) and Danielle Kang (69).
TEXAS OPENSi Woo Kim made a hole in one on the 16th role to maintain his lead after two rounds in San Antonio. Kim, the 2017 Players Championship winner, has a four-shot lead over six players, including Rickie Fowler and Jordan Spieth. Fowler led on the back nine until making consecutive bogeys late in the round.

The Australia Letteris a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau chief.Sign upto get it by email.
This week, we have a special treat:Karen Crouse, one of our sportswriters who was here for the Australian Open, spent time with Briony Lyle, the wife of Jarrod Lyle, one of Australia’s most beloved golfers, who died of cancer a few months ago.
He was only 36. Here’s hisNew York Times obituaryif you missed it.
We’ve turned the newsletter over to Karen and Briony, for insights on sport and life. Tell us what you think atnytaustralia@nytimes.com.
___
Briony Lyle laughs when she thinks about it now, but in the days after her husband, Jarrod, died following a lengthy battle with leukemia, she wondered what she would do with herself. For nearly a decade, her days had revolved around Jarrod’s schedule, first as a professional golfer and, later as a second-and-third-time cancer patient.
Jarrod’s death last August at age 36 unleasheda global outpouring of emotion and supportfrom people whose lives he touched or who were touched by the story of a seemingly regular bloke who had absorbed life’s — and golf’s — bad breaks with grit and good cheer.
At the time I marveled at how a group of athletes who tend to measure success so rigidly, who generally buy into the belief that they are what their scores say they are, rallied to give a farewell befitting a giant to Jarrod, a journeyman whose highest finish in 121 P.G.A. Tour starts was a tie for fourth.
Curious to know what life was like for Briony after the elegies stopped, I followed the Australia Day migration of beachgoers to Torquay, the gateway to the Great Ocean Road, where Briony and Jarrod moved in 2012 and where, she said, Jarrod peacefully passed his final days.
The half-year anniversary of Jarrod’s death was upon her, but that’s not why Briony saw reminders of her husband everywhere.
The day before, an American, Bryson DeChambeau, had claimed a seven-stroke victory at the Dubai Desert Classic, a European Tour event. Briony has never met the 25-year-old DeChambeau, but at the P.G.A. Championship, held the week after Jarrod’s death, DeChambeau won a long-driving contest and donated the $25,000 winner’s check to an education fund set up for the Lyles’s young daughters, Lusi, 6, and Jemma, 2.
Since then, Briony, who never really cared for golf, has been a huge fan of DeChambeau. She recently sent him a thank-you note, which began the same as hundreds of others that she had written over the past few months: “We may never meet, but what you did was so amazing, just to say thank you is not enough.”
This week in the United States, the P.G.A. Tour is outside Phoenix, for a tournament known for its party atmosphere, huge crowds and stadium-style 16th hole.
The par 3 has been the scene of nine aces, including one by Tiger Woods and another by Jarrod in what was perhaps the signature moment of his P.G.A. Tour career.
It happened during the second round of the 2011 event, and Jarrod’s reaction was almost as memorable as a result. While the shot was airborne, he made the motion to sit with both hands as if his golf ball were a puppy at obedience school. After the ball bounced on the green and rolled in the cup, he pumped his arms multiple times, then windmilled his arms to churn the already raucous crowd of more than 25,000 into even more of a lather.
Smiling ear to ear, he ran over to his caddie shouting, “You beauty,” only, in typical Jarrod fashion, with an expletive added for emphasis.
Briony said Jarrod replayed the video of the shot and his reaction hundreds of times over the years.
“He’d tell people not to believe all the views it has gotten because he’s been responsible for most of them,” she said. “People thought he was just being humble, but he was telling the truth.”
She laughed.
“He watched that video all the time. I can remember waking up to him giggling and I’d ask him what he was laughing at and he’d say, ‘I just watched the hole-in-one again.’”
Golf did not captivate Briony, who was a high school classmate of Jarrod’s in their hometown, Shepparton, in northern Victoria. When they started dating a few years later, she attended his tournaments but recognized early on that she was going to need a diversion.
“I couldn’t possibly spend my time walking aimlessly around golf courses pretending I was invested in every shot and every moment,” said Briony, who enrolled in classes in Melbourne to become a massage therapist. She accumulated her required training hours, she said, by setting up a massage table at tournaments and kneading the muscles of the caddies.
She earned her certification in 2012, shortly before giving birth to the couple’s first daughter, Lusi. Another daughter, Jemma, arrived four years later. Around the time of Lusi’s birth, Jarrod learned that the leukemia he had battled successfully in high school had returned.
He was off the P.G.A. Tour for more than two years,then came back and made 20 more starts. He had returned to Australia to play his home tour and try his hand at broadcasting when he found out in late 2017 that the leukemia had returned a third time.
During his initial battle with the disease, Jarrod became acquainted with Challenge, a nonprofit dedicated to providing practical and personalized services to the families of cancer patients. The organization’s mascot isa duck named Leuk, and since Jarrod’s death people from all over the world have snatched up Leuk merchandise, everything from duck head covers to pins and ball markers.
Next week top performers from the P.G.A. Tour of Australasia, the Australian Ladies Professional Golf, the European Tour and the Ladies European Tour will converge on Barwon Heads Golf Club, not far from Torquay, for the Vic Open. Briony will be there, selling Leuk the Duck merchandise to raise money for families dealing with cancer.
“I have my moments — many, many moments — mostly nighttime where I can’t sleep because of things playing over in my mind,” Briony said. “But I’m able to grab on to this incredible thing that came out of what happened, there’s so much good that came out of it and I’m just so determined to draw attention to this cause because I’m not unique, unfortunately.”
A bittersweet thing happened; she lost her golfer husband and found a calling that drew her deeper into golf.
“After he died, I kept telling people over and over, my life tended to revolve around Jarrod either in illness or career and now my life continues to revolve around him,” she said. “That’s the legacy.”

Gene Littler, a quietly outstanding golfer who was known as Gene the Machine for an uncommonly smooth and consistent swing that propelled him to the 1961 United States Open championship, died on Friday in San Diego. He was 88.
His death was announced by the PGA Tour. His son, Curt, told The San Diego Union-Tribune that he had neuropathy in his legs and had had several falls. In 1972, Littler had surgery for lymph cancer that had seemingly ended his career.
In his prime, though self-taught, he had “a perfect swing,” said Gene Sarazen, a winner of seven major championships. “Like Sam Snead’s, only better.”
Littler was typically self-effacing in assessing his form. “I just put the ball down and hit,” he once said.
Unassuming and devoid of glamour in an era dominated by Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player, and relatively unimposing at 5 foot 9 and 160 pounds or so, Littler simply went about winning tournaments: 29 on the PGA Tour and another eight on what was then the Senior PGA Tour.
Littler, who lost two other majors in playoffs and another by one stroke, was a seven-time Ryder Cup player and was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1990.
Littler was virtually ignored by the galleries in the early stages of the 1961 United State Open’s final round at Oakland Hills in Michigan. He was among a pack chasing Doug Sanders, who was three shots ahead after the third round, and he had injured a rib earlier in the year, sidelining him for two months. He had won a total of $116 in his first five tournaments of 1961. Not only that, but Littler needed to adjust his widely envied swing a few days before the tournament.
As Littler later told it, Ted Kroll, a fellow professional, “told me to hit the ball more directly, or more upright.”
Littler added, “I had a tendency to swing flat.”
It was Littler’s brilliant putting that carried him to victory at Oakland Hills, whose undulating greens frustrated many of the other contenders. He one-putted on six holes of the final round and needed only the customary two putts at the others, and he sank 15-foot putts at Nos. 7 and 13. After hitting into a bunker guarding the green on the 18th hole, he two-putted for a bogey 5 and a two-under-par 68 that bested Sanders and Bob Goalby by a shot.
Gene Alec Littler was born on July 21, 1930, in San Diego and grew to love golf while playing on area courses. He graduated from San Diego State University and then entered the Navy. He won the United States Amateur and played in the Walker Cup amateur competition between the United States and a British-Irish team in 1953.
The prominent golf writer Herbert Warren Wind was impressed by the fluidity of such a young player’s swing.
“Gene took the club back with a very, very slow, easy, relaxed rhythm, then paused a lazy second at the top before droning slowly down into the ball, delaying his accelerated hitting action until the very last moment when the club head was only two feet or so from the ball,” Wind wrote in 1955 in Sports Illustrated.
While still an amateur, Littler won the San Diego Open in January 1954, and he turned pro soon afterward. He almost won the United States Open in June 1954, losing to Ed Furgol by one stroke, and then won four tournaments in 1955. He captured the Tournament of Champions in Las Vegas three consecutive times, from 1955 to 1957. Littler lost to Billy Casper, a friend since their boyhood in San Diego, in an 18-hole playoff at the 1970 Masters.
Two years later, Littler was found to have lymph cancer, requiring surgery. Much of the muscular structure on his left side was removed. But through arduous rehabilitation, he was able to regain the use of his left arm and rejoin the tour. He won the St. Louis Children’s Hospital Classic in July 1973 and received the Ben Hogan Award as comeback player of the year and the Bob Jones Award for distinguished sportsmanship in golf.
Littler went to a playoff at the 1977 P.G.A. Championship at Pebble Beach, losing to Lanny Wadkins on the third hole of sudden death after leading by five strokes with nine holes to play.
He retired from the PGA Tour after that season and joined the fledgling Senior PGA Tour in 1981. Three years later he fell from a ladder while working on one of his antique cars and fractured his left arm, which was already weakened from cancer surgery. But he won six times on the Senior Tour after that.
In addition to his son, survivors include his wife, Shirley, and a daughter, Suzanne.
For all his achievements, and all the admiration for his swing, Littler struggled with self-doubt.
“I never gave myself enough credit,” he told The Union-Tribune in 1987. “If I could change anything, I’d change my attitude. I’d come out again like Nicklaus or Palmer. I think I had a lot of ability but I never had what those guys had, that confidence.”
The World Golf Hall of Fame quoted him once saying: “I drew a big gallery today. I was paired with Palmer.”

RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. — Jin Young Ko won the ANA Inspiration on Sunday at Mission Hills for her first major title and second victory in three weeks.
Ko closed with a 2-under 70 in hot and mostly calm conditions for a three-stroke victory over Mi Hyang Lee. She celebrated with the traditional winner's leap into Poppie's Pond.
After bogeys on 13 and 15 cut her lead to a stroke, Ko made a 6-foot birdie putt on the par-4 16th and closed with a 15-foot birdie putt on the par-5 18th.
Ko finished at 10-under 278. The 23-year-old South Korean won for the fourth time on the LPGA Tour, completing a desert sweep after taking the Founders Cup in Phoenix. She leads the money list and has five top-three finishes in six events this year.
Ko also gave caddie David Brooker his third victory in the event. The Englishman also leaped into Poppie's Pond with Grace Park in 2004 and Lorena Ochoa in 2008.
Lee parred the final six holes in a 70.
A stroke ahead of playing partner In-Kyung Kim entering the round, Ko had a three-stroke lead at the turn and faced little pressure until stumbling with the bogeys on 13 and 15. Her drive on the par-4 13th bounded down the fairway and jumped into the thick right rough, and her long approach ended up short of the green in the left rough. After missing a 12-foot birdie putt on the par-3 14th, she hit into the left greenside bunker on the par-4 15th and missed a 12-foot par try.
Lexi Thompson was third at 6 under after a 67.
Kim closed with a 74 to tie for fourth at 5 under with Carlota Ciganda. The 30-year-old South Korean lost a chance to win the event seven years after missing a 14-inch putt on the final hole of regulation and losing on the first hole of a playoff.
Ciganda finished with a 68.
PGA TOUR
SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Corey Conners won the Texas Open as Monday qualifier for his first PGA Tour title and a sport in the Masters.
The first Monday qualifier to win on the tour in nine years, the Canadian birdied three of the final five holes for his second straight 6-under 66 and a two-stroke victory over Charley Hoffman. Conners finished at 20-under 268 at TPC San Antonio.
Hoffman, the 2016 Texas Open winner, had weekend round of 64 and 67.
Ryan Moore closed with a 64, a shot off the course record, to finish third at 17 under.
PGA TOUR CHINA
SANYA, China (AP) — Officials at the Sanya Championship said Sunday that 28-year-old Malaysian golfer Arie Irawan died in his hotel room from "apparent natural causes," and the PGA Tour Series-China canceled the final round of the tournament.
American Trevor Sluman led after 54 holes with an 18-under total of 198 and was declared winner of the tournament. Three Americans — Matt Gilchrest, Max McGreevy and Michael Perras — were tied for second, two strokes behind.
The PGA Tour Series-China said in a statement that Irawan missed the 36-hole cut Friday in the tournament at Sanya Yalong Bay Golf Club. It said the official coroner's report had not been completed.
"Out of respect for the family, officials canceled the final round of the Sanya Championship ... it's a true tragedy what has happened. Sometimes, though, things happen in life that are bigger than a sporting event," the tour said.

It is hard to imagine Augusta without Whitey Lester, a downtown fixture for decades and the city’s last strip-club impresario.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — “Folks,” the radio host wrote on his Facebook page, “reports of Whitey Lester’s death were apparently incorrect.”
It was just before Christmas, and the host, Austin Rhodes, was in the awkward position ofretractinghis on-air announcement about James Lester, who is known to everyone in Augusta as Whitey — and who remains very much alive.
It was a cringe-worthy error. But it also set off a mini-explosion of civic speculation about what Augusta, derided as “Disgusta” by detractors, might eventually be like without Mr. Lester, downtown’s very last strip-club impresario, the man whose businesses have for decades offered a lubricious counterpoint to the Masters Tournament, the hallowed yearly pilgrimage for golf fans hosted by the Augusta National Golf Club that begins this week.
Bartenders, strippers, real estate speculators, golf fans, preachers and politicians — they are all wondering what a post-Whitey Lester world might look like, and whether his clubs really would go with him.
Despite reports that Mr. Lester, who is in his mid-70s, has been in ill health, his son, Butch Lester, said in a brief interview that his father was nowhere near death, and he lamented that so much seemed to turn on the matter.
“That’s a lot of fuss for one man living or dying,” he said.
But it is hard to imagine the town without him. It was Mr. Lester who was responsible for the regionally famous striptease act known as The Snake Lady, an unholy pretzel of human and reptilian flesh that titillated many a golfer, soldier and late-teenage boy.The dancer and a boa constrictor or two would emerge with the “Jaws” theme playing. A voice would announce a visitor from the “Devil’s den.”
He was the obviousgo-to quotefor The New York Post in 2010 when it trumpeted the 19th-hole hot-cha-cha that has long defined Augusta’s relationship with its famous golf tournament.
For years, Mr. Lester was also a headline-generating juggernaut for the local paper. He was the man who defied Bible Belt convention and survived a career in the cross hairs of evangelical Christians, prudish city officials, and even — in that odd way that the long putt of history sometimes breaks — an assistant United States attorney general named Robert S. Mueller III.
These days, according to his critics, Mr. Lester is also standing in the way of progress. His detractors contend that his two strip clubs along Broad Street, the Discotheque Lounge and Vegas Showgirls, are the last seedy obstacles hindering a downtown revitalization that might finallyhelp Augustashed its reputation as a sort of unglamorous urban crust around the sparkling green geode that is the Augusta National.
“We don’t want to continue to be the butt of jokes,” said Matt Aitken, a former member of the city-county commission and a real estate agent who has a number of properties listed near Mr. Lester’s clubs. “We want to be on the cutting edge of economic prosperity, and to be cool.”
A former mill town of 200,000 people about a two-hour drive east of Atlanta, Augusta has waited a long time for its makeover. Its urban core suffered more than most, not only from suburbanization, butfire,floodsand a bitter 1970race riot. For decades, the downtown was defined by empty storefronts, pawn shops, and places like the Discotheque, the more famous of Mr. Lester’s clubs.
But now, finally, there is energy. There is a fledgling tech sector, helped alongby the planned moveof the United States Army’s Cyber Command headquarters from Virginia to nearby Fort Gordon. There is a handsome new $40 million convention center and a lovingly restored 1940 theater. There are pedestrians. There is a restaurant on Broad Street that serves quail bisque and pork belly rillette.
It all starts to taper off the closer one gets to the block with the strip joints, to the chagrin of the real estate agents dreaming of lofts and coffee shops. That block “is like a big missing tooth in the whole city,” said Jonathan Aceves, an agent and head of the neighborhood association for Olde Town, the residential area just to the east.
But the fate of that block of Broad Street and the mortality of Mr. Lester are tangled like woman and snake. The law made it so. In 1994, when six strip clubs were operating downtown, city officials made it illegal for nude clubs to serve alcohol. But they allowed the owners of the existing clubs, including Mr. Lester, to keep their alcohol licenses until the clubs closed or the owner died.
And so everybody waits.
They do not mean anything personal by it. But “people made business decisions based on the fact that these clubs would eventually close,” said Joe Edge, president of Sherman & Hemstreet, the company where Mr. Aitken works.
Augusta is the birthplace of the Southern Baptist Convention and, predictably, many have wanted Mr. Lester gone. In 1986, the mayor at the time, Charles A. DeVaney, was livid when a photo book meant to celebrate America’s cities — and sponsored by the United States Conference of Mayors — used a picture of the Discotheque to illustrate the city.
“Savannah gets the river, Macon a beautiful fountain and Augusta gets a nightspot that advertises a snake lady,” Mr. DeVaney complained.
In 1991, city leaders, still on the warpath, passed a law that banned nude dancing in clubs that sold alcohol. But the Discotheque management filed a court challenge and got an injunction, and the Georgia Supreme Court eventually ruled the law unconstitutional.
The next year, Mr. Lester faced his biggest test when he was indicted on four counts of underpaying federal income tax, part of a four-year investigation into what federal officials believed was an illegal gambling operation being run out of the Discotheque and a cavernous pool hall Mr. Lester owns next door called Riverfront Pub & Sports.
According to court documents, Mr. Mueller authorized the local United States attorney’s office to apply for an order allowing the wiretap of Mr. Lester’s office. The Discotheque and the pool hall were seized and padlocked by federal officials on a Friday morning in February. The authorities also seized hundreds of thousands of dollars — and hauled away the snakes.
More than a dozen people pleaded guilty to gambling charges as part of the inquiry. But the civil and criminal cases against Mr. Lester went nowhere. His properties were returned to him on April 3, just before the start of that year’s Masters Tournament.
Benjamin E. Nicholson V, one of Mr. Lester’s lawyers at the time, said that Mr. Lester was relieved to open just before the crush of Masters traffic. “Whitey had a contingent of Japanese that would spend a million bucks at the Masters,” Mr. Nicholson recalled, “and that made his year.”
Mr. Nicholson recalled that one snake died in federal custody and taxpayers compensated Mr. Lester handsomely for it.
When it comes to the local power structure, Mr. Lester has always counted powerful friends among his enemies. Few were surprised when, in 2012, he served asan honorary pallbearerat the funeral of the longtime local sheriff. And few were surprised when, in the run-up to this year’s Masters Tournament, city officials briefly considered a proposal that would allow Mr. Lester to pass his license down to family members.
When Mr. Edge caught wind of the proposal, he raised hell, and filed an online petition opposing it. It garnered 1,500 signatures and the idea went nowhere.
While it is legal to operate a strip club beyond downtown in Augusta’s industrial zones, none have opened because of a prohibition on liquor licenses. But this week, amid concerns thattourism might be impactedby a dearth of strip clubs, Augusta commissioners agreed to lift the prohibition. It was not immediately clear whether the Lester family would move their businesses.
On a recent afternoon at the Riverfront Pub, an employee eating chicken fingers at the bar said that Mr. Lester was not available for comment. The place was covered with photos reflecting a life in the nimbus of a certain kind of fame.
One photo featured Mr. Lester, bearded and smiling and looking like a roadie for a Southern rock band, next to the basketball legend Scottie Pippen. There were photos of gamblers and golfers and expert billiard players named Weenie Beanie and Cornbread Red. There was a photo of Muhammad Ali, signed by the legend: “To Mighty Whitey,” it says. “Good luck.”
Later that night at the Discotheque, Gina Virella, 32, a dancer, said she was studying to be a nurse. She was not too worried about her future. Some of the other dancers, she said, would have to move out of town when the place closed.
There was trap music on the sound system, and a framed newspaper article from the day Mr. Lester beat the feds.
There was also a framed cartoon that showed a lady from the local chamber of commerce with brochures on all of the attractions Augusta wants its visitors to see.
“Yeah those places sound great,” a bug-eyed male visitor tells her, “But what I’m really looking for is the famous Discotheque!!!”

By Manny Fernandez in Donna, Tex.
It’s springtime on the border, and that means the winter season is winding down — the months when tens of thousands of retirees from Minnesota, South Dakota, Illinois and other parts of the Midwest adopt South Texas as their home away from home.
Retirees in swimsuits ride their bicycles to the pool, bright noodles tucked under their arms like jousting lances. They line the streets for golf-cart parades. They venture into Mexico, shopping for cheap medicine, getting pedicures, undergoing low-cost dental work and sipping goblet-sized margaritas.
They are known as Winter Texans, and they concentrate mainly in the Rio Grande Valley, the temperate region deep in South Texas that is also the place where the largest number of migrants has been crossing lately from Central America — President Trump has declared a national emergency along the border and stationed Army troops to help control the escalating influx. One of their base camps was a quarter-mile from where seniors at the Victoria Palms resort in Donna deploy by the dozens to occupy five pickleball courts.
The annual invasion of Midwesterners — and a number of Canadians — has decreased in recent years, but they remain an economic and cultural force. An estimated 106,000 Winter Texans spent about $528 million in the valley in the 2017-18 winter season, according to a survey by the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. Tex-Mex restaurants fly welcome banners for them. There are Winter Texan newspapers, age-qualified RV parks, expos, cruises, theater productions and bumper stickers — one pickup truck in the border city of McAllen had two: “Iowa Winter Texan” and “I’m retired. Go around.”
“It gets me out of the snowbanks,” said Dean Miller, 58, a resident of Detroit Lakes, Minn., who spends the winter living and working at the Winter Ranch resort in Alamo. “You’ll go to some event down here and you’ll find your neighbor from back home.”
The majority of Winter Texans are white and in their early 70s. Many of them voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, and their very presence this winter quietly subverted the president’s assertion that the border is in crisis. They have been coming to the region for years — in some cases, their parents were Winter Texans, too — and the political dynamics and national-emergency rhetoric has no effect on how, or where, they spend their retirement.
“We don’t see what you see on TV,” said Terry Goss, the general manager of Victoria Palms, one of the largest Winter Texan communities, with up to 2,500 retirees.
What do Winter Texans see, exactly?
A slice of border life that looks nothing like what many Americans think of as border life. There was Nathan’s fourth annual Sock Hop at Ranchero Village in Weslaco one Friday. There were fish frys and riverboat tours, line dancing and karaoke sessions, bluegrass acoustic jams and nondenominational church services. At the Winter Ranch resort in Alamo one Monday afternoon, the Winter Ranch Players packed the house with three one-act plays, “The Ethel and Albert Comedies.” At Victoria Palms, Mr. Goss spoke standing next to a poster listing all the sold-out shows at the resort’s ballroom, one of them a Rolling Stones tribute band concert. Victoria Palms is so popular with Canadians that a Victoria Palms reunion is scheduled most summers near Toronto.
Margaret Hitzemann, 63, who normally lives in Onamia, Minn., spent the past two months in a townhouse in Port Aransas, near Corpus Christi. One rainy afternoon, she and her husband visited the Mexican tourist town of Nuevo Progreso. They bought crispy chapulines — crickets, a fried delicacy — and went into a pharmacy to buy some cheap medicine.
“We don’t take a lot of meds, so we were thinking, ‘Oh, let’s go down and get some cheap Tylenol and Advil and that kind of thing,’” Ms. Hitzemann said. “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, this isn’t any cheaper than Walmart.’ So we ended up not buying any medications.”
In a region with a large Latino population and tolerant attitudes toward immigration — many people have family members on both sides of the border — culture clash with the Northerners is inevitable. The study released by the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley included unedited messages from Winter Texans to local officials, and some of the sharpest comments read: “Be more American, less Mexican. This is not Mexico!” and “Have channel 5 respect Mr. Trump” and “Keep the grass cut, the trash picked up and speak English.”
Already, the exodus back north has started. The end of the season for many comes on Thursday, with the annual Winter Texan appreciation day in Nuevo Progreso.
For some, the season never ends. There are Converted Texans, former Winter Texans who settle in the valley for good. Kristi Collier, a McAllen native who runs a media and hospitality company that caters to Winter Texans called Welcome Home, Rio Grande Valley, hosts an annual Converted Texan Fiesta in April. (She leads a swearing-in ceremony.)
Among the ranks of the converted are Ken and Lois Lane, originally from Anchorage, who started spending winters at Victoria Palms in 2005. They now live there permanently in a double-wide mobile home.
“I think the cost of living here is very reasonable, compared to many other places,” said Mr. Lane, 73, a retired power dispatcher for an electrical company.
He and his wife visited Nuevo Progreso and hosted their son and his family from Iowa over spring break. The couple is in a unique category: sort of reverse Winter Texans.
“The motor home we kept and in the summer when it gets real hot, we go up north,” Mr. Lane said.

“There are people out there who just say, ‘Send them all back and build a wall.’ But they would be facing empty shelves in the grocery store if that were to happen.”
— Mike McMahon, a dairy farmer in upstate New York.
The farms of upstate New York are thousands of miles from the southern border, but close enough to the northern one that the Border Patrol has jurisdiction. Farmers’ reliance on undocumented workers had made the region a focal point in the debate over the Trump administration’s border policies, leading to tensions between state politicians of both parties and the federal agents enforcing the president’s crackdown on illegal immigration.
Christina Goldbaum, an immigration reporter in The New York Times’s Metro department, explored Mr. McMahon’s story, and those of migrants who work at farms like his, in an article this week.Read more about it here.
This week, KPBS, a public radio station in Southern California, launched a new podcast, “Only Here,” about life and culture in San Diego and Tijuana — “the art, food, traditions and culture that exists because of the border,” they write. The first episode profiles a young photographer who is gay and undocumented,and you can listen to it, along with other episodes, here.
Podcast creators, like everyone else, have been drawn to stories and conversations about the border. If you prefer your stories in audio form, here are a few more to get you started:
• “The Green Line,” produced by the union of Border Patrol agents. The hosts, Art Del Cueto and Brandon Judd, are Border Patrol agents who have been supportive of President Trump’s policies — and bothappeared at his sidein the White House briefing room in January when he talked about declaring a national emergency to help build a border wall. (The Times has written about them before.)
• Last spring, WNYC’s Radiolab ran “Border Project,” a three-part series about a Border Patrol policy that most likely led to a rise, beginning in the late 1990s, in the number of migrants who died while crossing to the United States. It also profiles some of the migrants who made the trek despite it.Listen to all the episodes here.
• This episode of PRX’s Radio Diaries, “The Border Wall,” focuses on those strange parts of the border that one woman calls a “no-man’s land,” cut off from their country by a barrier that doesn’t always follow the line it’s meant to.
• Our very own “Daily” podcast has many great episodes from the border. Start with a two-part series, “Dispatches From the Border” (Part 1 hereandPart 2 here), which follows Azam Ahmed, the Times bureau chief for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, and other Times journalists on a trip along the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico. Then there’s this episode, “The Scars of Family Separation,” about a migrant father who crossed the border with his daughter. Finally, from last summer, “How Separating Migrant Families Became U.S. Policy” is an interview with Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser who has helped the president frame his immigration policy.

SAN DIEGO — A year ago, Tiger Woods was ranked No. 647 in the world when he arrived at Torrey Pines Golf Course. He was coming off career-threatening spinal-fusion surgery, had not won on tour in almost five years and was happy just to be playing after another long layoff.
The operation to fuse two vertebrae in his lower back, he said this week, was “the last-ditch effort to give me quality of life” even if it did not allow him to compete at the highest level of professional golf again. That is why he had low expectations heading into 2018 and said he was “pleased” to make the cut and finish tied for 23rd at the Farmers Insurance Open.
A year later, much has changed, including Woods’s expectations. He made his season debut Thursday, again at Torrey Pines, but this time coming off a season of steady progress that culminated in his September victory at the Tour Championship in Atlanta — his 80th PGA Tour title, but his first since 2013. He had also climbed to No. 13 in the world rankings.
Woods shot a two-under-par 70 in the opening round on the South Course, putting him eight shots behind the leader, Jon Rahm, in a tie for 53rd, but he seemed anything but discouraged. He has winning on his mind again.
“This year, it’s totally different,” he said. “I have a great understanding of what I can and can’t do. There’s not the uncertainty that I had going into the year last year, after what I did at the end of last year. I know what I’m feeling, so now it’s about finishing a littler better and winning some events.”
Woods has won eight titles at Torrey Pines as a pro — including the 2008 United States Open — and one Junior World Championships title as an amateur. It will, however, be a tall order to catch the leaders in a field featuring 12 of the world’s top 20 players — especially after Rahm, the world No. 7 and the 2017 tournament champion, set a record for the renovated North Course with a 62. One shot back is the world No. 1, Justin Rose, who also played the North Course.
Woods said he knew what that meant as he headed to that course for the second round on Friday. “That forces me to shoot a low one, because everybody on the North went low today,” he said.
Everyone in the 156-player field plays one round on the South Course and one on the North before the 36-hole cut is established. The cut last year was one under par, the score Woods had in advancing to weekend play for the first time since 2015.
On Thursday, Woods made five birdies and three bogeys, with three of his birdies coming on par 5s: Nos. 6 (9-foot putt), 9 (15-footer) and 18 (12-footer). He drove the ball well until midway through the back nine, when he missed three consecutive tee shots to the right. He managed to save par from the right rough on the 14th and 15th holes, but he failed get up and down from a greenside bunker on the par-3 16th and made bogey.
“Over all, it was a pretty solid day,” he said. “I felt I drove it pretty well. Even though I missed a few fairways, they were controllable. My feel was a little off, but that should get better.”
His best shot of the day was a towering 6-iron on the 215-yard, par-3 11th hole that rolled to a stop 3 feet from the cup. He made the birdie putt to reach two under, but not until he had summoned a rules official to explain that he had accidentally moved his ball while addressing it on the green.
“I was about to build my stance, and the ball moved,” he said. “So I had to move it back to where it originally was.”
After his win in the Tour Championship, Woods had played competitively only three times — in the Ryder Cup in Paris, where he went 0-4 and was admittedly fatigued after playing seven events in nine weeks; a Thanksgiving weekend exhibition match in Las Vegas against Phil Mickelson; and his annual charity tournament in the Bahamas the first week of December.
He said he had used the six weeks off before the Farmers to spend “a lot of time in the gym, trying to get stronger,” and to relax, often free-diving and spearfishing near his home in Florida — hobbies that he said he had missed while dealing with chronic back problems in recent years.
“Last year, toward the end of the season, I got really tired because I didn’t expect to play that much golf, and I didn’t train for it,” he said. “But now I feel like my legs are where they need to be. That’s why I’ve been so diligent about training. But there are days when I just don’t practice and I don’t train. That’s probably been one of the lessons I’ve learned through all of this is there are days where I just have to shut it down and just not do anything and just relax.”

Sarsfield, AUSTRALIA — Greg Carter really likes to golf. The Australian Vietnam War veteran enjoys it so much that one day in 2006, his wife Anne suggested that he put a hole in the yard of their sprawling 52-acre property.
“When I got over there, I looked across the valley and thought, gee whiz, I could put another one on that little hill,” he recalled, while giving a tour of the grounds recently. He mowed the grass and put in a few more holes, he said.
Thirteen years later, the result is a private golf course set in hilly farmland in the southeastern state of Victoria, about a three-and-a-half-hour drive from Melbourne.
But the meaning of the property to the Carters goes beyond the sport of golf. Since the course was built, the couple has opened up the grounds to Australian war veterans and their families to use as a cost-free retreat.
Mr. Carter was deployed in Vietnam for 12 months in 1969, and the idea for a retreat came to him after he realized the abrupt transition that many war veterans faced after returning home. For those reluctant to seek out government support or clubs, he said, there were few resources. While mapping out the course, Mr. Carter thought that the property, with its nature-steeped solitude, could offer veterans a place to feel safe, secure and away from the public.
Hundreds have used the retreat over the years, the Carters said, as a place to connect with others who understand what they’ve been through. For civilians who have not been to war, Mr. Carter said, the psychological impact of military service is difficult to understand.
After Mr. Carter opened the retreat, named Cockatoo Rise, and alerted veterans’ organizations, “the word got around reasonably quickly,” he said.
The property includes a 42-square-meter, or roughly 450-square-foot, home, six fenced paddocks, a large shed, a garden and an outdoor barbecue area.
But the Carters are approaching their 70s and looking to sell. They have put the entire property, which includes a four-bedroom, two-bath house, on the market. “For somebody who’s retired, this would be the dream,” Mr. Carter said. “They can make their rules up and their own dress code.”
The asking price is 1.79 million Australian dollars, or about $1.27 million.
In recent years, the housing market has boomed in nearby Bairnsdale, real estate agents said, with interest from investors from cities like Melbourne and Sydney. But only a few properties in the area sell for over 1 million Australian dollars, putting the Carters’ home on the very high end of the market, said Ross Tucker, a sales consultant at LJ Hooker Bairnsdale. In the last seven years, Mr. Tucker said, two nearby properties have sold for more than 1 million dollars: a colonial mansion on five acres on a river and an architecturally distinctive house set on two acres.
In Bairnsdale, the average price for a three-bedroom home is about 300,000 dollars, Mr. Tucker said. The price of farmland is more varied: land with rich soils used for agriculture can sell for about 12,000 dollars an acre and bushland for as little as 2,000 dollars an acre.
Property values also come down to location, said Sean Sabell, a director at Elders Real Estate Bairnsdale, with some buyers willing to pay more for water and mountain views.
Originally, Mr. Carter laid out an 18-hole course, but he eventually scaled it back to nine.
It took about six years for it to come together. Mr. Carter mowed fairways and planted gum, lilly pilly and protea trees. A line of pines traces one fairway, though such trees are rare on Australian golf courses because their root systems can grow into fairways and disturb the game, Mr. Carter said.
Water from a dam on the property is used to water the greens. In recent months, to conserve water during an especially dry Australian summer, nine tee boxes have been set up around four holes, allowing for abbreviated play.
The main house, built when the Carters arrived 15 years ago, has an open-plan design, with high ceilings and sliding-glass windows to let in the light.
The building’s main draw is an outdoor dining area facing south, with a 300-degree view overlooking the undulating landscape to the nearby waters of the Gippsland Lakes and to the mountains in the west. Often, visiting veterans will sit there alongside a rock-bordered pond and its goldfish.
Because the Carters regularly throw parties for friends, they make heavy use of their 60-foot-long (18-meter) living room, which includes a fireplace and an indoor pond.
The surrounding Gippsland Lakes region includes parks, bushland and some of the country’s largest waterways. Bairnsdale, a town ofabout 15,000 people, is minutes from the property and the local community is close-knit.
Currently, the shed houses a museum, where Mr. Carter displays a vast collection of wartime relics, including uniforms, replicas of mines and ration packs. The museum will move with them when they leave. “We haven’t set this up to relive the war,” Mr. Carter said. “It’s a teaching ground.”
Some of the veterans the Carters have hosted are homeless or struggle with mental health issues. One Afghanistan veteran called Mr. Carter, despondent, after 19 fellow servicemen had committed suicide. “He had hit rock bottom,” Mr. Carter said, wiping away tears.
On most evenings, the Carters keep a campfire burning on a corner of their property. Sometimes, the veterans who gather there are silent. But other times, lulled by the fire and the nature around them, they start talking about what they remember.
John Cottom, a Vietnam veteran who visited the retreat in February, said he has found that psychiatrists can be intimidating to talk to about wartime experiences. Apart from the Carters, the best part of the Cockatoo Rise retreat, he said, is meeting other veterans.
“You can sit down and talk and you don’t have to explain things” said Mr. Cottom, who is 71. “You relax and let some things out.”
Although he hasn’t met anyone he served with, he said, “It’s like we know each other. It’s a special friendship.”
The wives of veterans, he added, are made very welcome, too. “The women are often overlooked, but they’ve gone through hell, too, putting up with us,” Mr. Cottom said.
Frank Hoy, 70 and a veteran of the Royal Australian Navy, first visited the retreat from his home in Melbourne four years ago and has returned several times. “We sit around the fire and solve the problems of the world,” Mr. Hoy said.
Several real estate agents in the area expressed skepticism that the Carters could achieve their asking price, but the couple said that they have done their research and are not fazed.
At dusk, native birds and other wildlife emerge from hiding. After Mr. Carter’s tour, several cockatoos alighted on a eucalyptus tree by the kitchen window. A few eastern grey kangaroos appeared and nibbled the grass.
“We’ve got a really old boy that comes through every night,” Anne Carter said, adding that sightings of echidnas — also known as spiny anteaters — and wombats are also common.
“It’ll be a disappointment for Anne and I to leave here,” Mr. Carter said as a kangaroo peered into the house. The Carters plan to take the Cockatoo Rise name with them to their next home but hope the property’s next owners will consider keeping it accessible to veterans. “We’d be delighted if they did that. Absolutely delighted,” Mr. Carter said.

(Reuters) - England's Meghan MacLaren finished second in the inaugural Jordan Mixed Open on Saturday, two strokes behind Daan Huizing of the Netherlands.
MacLaren, a Ladies European Tour winner, held a two-stroke lead going into the third round but ended at 14 under after a closing 72 as Huizing carded 68 to finish 16 under par.
The event held at the Ayla Golf Club in Aqaba was the first professional tournament in which men and women competed against each other for the same prize.
MacLaren, who started with two rounds of 65, struggled in the final round as she bogeyed the sixth and 10th holes before double-bogeying the 11th.
"I'm obviously pretty disappointed not to win this week, having been in such a good position," MacLaren said. "But it was still an honor to be here and represent women's golf alongside two other great tours."
Huizing was delighted with his victory.
"It's a big moment for me," Huizing said. "I've had a rough time at home recently so this is a really sweet way to prove to myself that I've got it.
"I think it's an historical event. It's a different vibe and very special to be the first winner and I hope it's something that can be continued in the future.
"Meghan, thank you very much for the great battle today. You played great."
Forty professionals and one amateur player each from the Challenge Tour, the over-50s Tour and the Ladies European Tour were in the field, were playing for a prize fund of about $400,000.

This week, we have a special treat:Karen Crouse, one of our sportswriters who was here for the Australian Open, spent time with Briony Lyle, the wife of Jarrod Lyle, one of Australia’s most beloved golfers, who died of cancer a few months ago.
He was only 36. Here’s hisNew York Times obituaryif you missed it.
We’ve turned the newsletter over to Karen and Briony, for insights on sport and life. Tell us what you think atnytaustralia@nytimes.com.

Briony Lyle laughs when she thinks about it now, but in the days after her husband, Jarrod, died following a lengthy battle with leukemia, she wondered what she would do with herself. For nearly a decade, her days had revolved around Jarrod’s schedule, first as a professional golfer and, later as a second-and-third-time cancer patient.
Jarrod’s death last August at age 36 unleasheda global outpouring of emotion and supportfrom people whose lives he touched or who were touched by the story of a seemingly regular bloke who had absorbed life’s — and golf’s — bad breaks with grit and good cheer.
At the time I marveled at how a group of athletes who tend to measure success so rigidly, who generally buy into the belief that they are what their scores say they are, rallied to give a farewell befitting a giant to Jarrod, a journeyman whose highest finish in 121 P.G.A. Tour starts was a tie for fourth.
Curious to know what life was like for Briony after the elegies stopped, I followed the Australia Day migration of beachgoers to Torquay, the gateway to the Great Ocean Road, where Briony and Jarrod moved in 2012 and where, she said, Jarrod peacefully passed his final days.
The half-year anniversary of Jarrod’s death was upon her, but that’s not why Briony saw reminders of her husband everywhere.
The day before, an American, Bryson DeChambeau, had claimed a seven-stroke victory at the Dubai Desert Classic, a European Tour event. Briony has never met the 25-year-old DeChambeau, but at the P.G.A. Championship, held the week after Jarrod’s death, DeChambeau won a long-driving contest and donated the $25,000 winner’s check to an education fund set up for the Lyles’s young daughters, Lusi, 6, and Jemma, 2.
Since then, Briony, who never really cared for golf, has been a huge fan of DeChambeau. She recently sent him a thank-you note, which began the same as hundreds of others that she had written over the past few months: “We may never meet, but what you did was so amazing, just to say thank you is not enough.”
This week in the United States, the P.G.A. Tour is outside Phoenix, for a tournament known for its party atmosphere, huge crowds and stadium-style 16th hole.
The par 3 has been the scene of nine aces, including one by Tiger Woods and another by Jarrod in what was perhaps the signature moment of his P.G.A. Tour career.
It happened during the second round of the 2011 event, and Jarrod’s reaction was almost as memorable as a result. While the shot was airborne, he made the motion to sit with both hands as if his golf ball were a puppy at obedience school. After the ball bounced on the green and rolled in the cup, he pumped his arms multiple times, then windmilled his arms to churn the already raucous crowd of more than 25,000 into even more of a lather.
Smiling ear to ear, he ran over to his caddie shouting, “You beauty,” only, in typical Jarrod fashion, with an expletive added for emphasis.
Briony said Jarrod replayed the video of the shot and his reaction hundreds of times over the years.
“He’d tell people not to believe all the views it has gotten because he’s been responsible for most of them,” she said. “People thought he was just being humble, but he was telling the truth.”
She laughed.
“He watched that video all the time. I can remember waking up to him giggling and I’d ask him what he was laughing at and he’d say, ‘I just watched the hole-in-one again.’”
Golf did not captivate Briony, who was a high school classmate of Jarrod’s in their hometown, Shepparton, in northern Victoria. When they started dating a few years later, she attended his tournaments but recognized early on that she was going to need a diversion.
“I couldn’t possibly spend my time walking aimlessly around golf courses pretending I was invested in every shot and every moment,” said Briony, who enrolled in classes in Melbourne to become a massage therapist. She accumulated her required training hours, she said, by setting up a massage table at tournaments and kneading the muscles of the caddies.
She earned her certification in 2012, shortly before giving birth to the couple’s first daughter, Lusi. Another daughter, Jemma, arrived four years later. Around the time of Lusi’s birth, Jarrod learned that the leukemia he had battled successfully in high school had returned.
He was off the P.G.A. Tour for more than two years,then came back and made 20 more starts. He had returned to Australia to play his home tour and try his hand at broadcasting when he found out in late 2017 that the leukemia had returned a third time.
During his initial battle with the disease, Jarrod became acquainted with Challenge, a nonprofit dedicated to providing practical and personalized services to the families of cancer patients. The organization’s mascot isa duck named Leuk, and since Jarrod’s death people from all over the world have snatched up Leuk merchandise, everything from duck head covers to pins and ball markers.
Next week top performers from the P.G.A. Tour of Australasia, the Australian Ladies Professional Golf, the European Tour and the Ladies European Tour will converge on Barwon Heads Golf Club, not far from Torquay, for the Vic Open. Briony will be there, selling Leuk the Duck merchandise to raise money for families dealing with cancer.
“I have my moments — many, many moments — mostly nighttime where I can’t sleep because of things playing over in my mind,” Briony said. “But I’m able to grab on to this incredible thing that came out of what happened, there’s so much good that came out of it and I’m just so determined to draw attention to this cause because I’m not unique, unfortunately.”
A bittersweet thing happened; she lost her golfer husband and found a calling that drew her deeper into golf.
“After he died, I kept telling people over and over, my life tended to revolve around Jarrod either in illness or career and now my life continues to revolve around him,” she said. “That’s the legacy.”

By Manny Fernandez in Donna, Tex.
It’s springtime on the border, and that means the winter season is winding down — the months when tens of thousands of retirees from Minnesota, South Dakota, Illinois and other parts of the Midwest adopt South Texas as their home away from home.
Retirees in swimsuits ride their bicycles to the pool, bright noodles tucked under their arms like jousting lances. They line the streets for golf-cart parades. They venture into Mexico, shopping for cheap medicine, getting pedicures, undergoing low-cost dental work and sipping goblet-sized margaritas.
They are known as Winter Texans, and they concentrate mainly in the Rio Grande Valley, the temperate region deep in South Texas that is also the place where the largest number of migrants has been crossing lately from Central America — President Trump has declared a national emergency along the border and stationed Army troops to help control the escalating influx. One of their base camps was a quarter-mile from where seniors at the Victoria Palms resort in Donna deploy by the dozens to occupy five pickleball courts.
The annual invasion of Midwesterners — and a number of Canadians — has decreased in recent years, but they remain an economic and cultural force. An estimated 106,000 Winter Texans spent about $528 million in the valley in the 2017-18 winter season, according to a survey by the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. Tex-Mex restaurants fly welcome banners for them. There are Winter Texan newspapers, age-qualified RV parks, expos, cruises, theater productions and bumper stickers — one pickup truck in the border city of McAllen had two: “Iowa Winter Texan” and “I’m retired. Go around.”
“It gets me out of the snowbanks,” said Dean Miller, 58, a resident of Detroit Lakes, Minn., who spends the winter living and working at the Winter Ranch resort in Alamo. “You’ll go to some event down here and you’ll find your neighbor from back home.”
The majority of Winter Texans are white and in their early 70s. Many of them voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, and their very presence this winter quietly subverted the president’s assertion that the border is in crisis. They have been coming to the region for years — in some cases, their parents were Winter Texans, too — and the political dynamics and national-emergency rhetoric has no effect on how, or where, they spend their retirement.
“We don’t see what you see on TV,” said Terry Goss, the general manager of Victoria Palms, one of the largest Winter Texan communities, with up to 2,500 retirees.
What do Winter Texans see, exactly?
A slice of border life that looks nothing like what many Americans think of as border life. There was Nathan’s fourth annual Sock Hop at Ranchero Village in Weslaco one Friday. There were fish frys and riverboat tours, line dancing and karaoke sessions, bluegrass acoustic jams and nondenominational church services. At the Winter Ranch resort in Alamo one Monday afternoon, the Winter Ranch Players packed the house with three one-act plays, “The Ethel and Albert Comedies.” At Victoria Palms, Mr. Goss spoke standing next to a poster listing all the sold-out shows at the resort’s ballroom, one of them a Rolling Stones tribute band concert. Victoria Palms is so popular with Canadians that a Victoria Palms reunion is scheduled most summers near Toronto.
Margaret Hitzemann, 63, who normally lives in Onamia, Minn., spent the past two months in a townhouse in Port Aransas, near Corpus Christi. One rainy afternoon, she and her husband visited the Mexican tourist town of Nuevo Progreso. They bought crispy chapulines — crickets, a fried delicacy — and went into a pharmacy to buy some cheap medicine.
“We don’t take a lot of meds, so we were thinking, ‘Oh, let’s go down and get some cheap Tylenol and Advil and that kind of thing,’” Ms. Hitzemann said. “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, this isn’t any cheaper than Walmart.’ So we ended up not buying any medications.”
In a region with a large Latino population and tolerant attitudes toward immigration — many people have family members on both sides of the border — culture clash with the Northerners is inevitable. The study released by the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley included unedited messages from Winter Texans to local officials, and some of the sharpest comments read: “Be more American, less Mexican. This is not Mexico!” and “Have channel 5 respect Mr. Trump” and “Keep the grass cut, the trash picked up and speak English.”
Already, the exodus back north has started. The end of the season for many comes on Thursday, with the annual Winter Texan appreciation day in Nuevo Progreso.
For some, the season never ends. There are Converted Texans, former Winter Texans who settle in the valley for good. Kristi Collier, a McAllen native who runs a media and hospitality company that caters to Winter Texans called Welcome Home, Rio Grande Valley, hosts an annual Converted Texan Fiesta in April. (She leads a swearing-in ceremony.)
Among the ranks of the converted are Ken and Lois Lane, originally from Anchorage, who started spending winters at Victoria Palms in 2005. They now live there permanently in a double-wide mobile home.
“I think the cost of living here is very reasonable, compared to many other places,” said Mr. Lane, 73, a retired power dispatcher for an electrical company.
He and his wife visited Nuevo Progreso and hosted their son and his family from Iowa over spring break. The couple is in a unique category: sort of reverse Winter Texans.
“The motor home we kept and in the summer when it gets real hot, we go up north,” Mr. Lane said.

“There are people out there who just say, ‘Send them all back and build a wall.’ But they would be facing empty shelves in the grocery store if that were to happen.”
— Mike McMahon, a dairy farmer in upstate New York.
The farms of upstate New York are thousands of miles from the southern border, but close enough to the northern one that the Border Patrol has jurisdiction. Farmers’ reliance on undocumented workers had made the region a focal point in the debate over the Trump administration’s border policies, leading to tensions between state politicians of both parties and the federal agents enforcing the president’s crackdown on illegal immigration.
Christina Goldbaum, an immigration reporter in The New York Times’s Metro department, explored Mr. McMahon’s story, and those of migrants who work at farms like his, in an article this week.Read more about it here.
This week, KPBS, a public radio station in Southern California, launched a new podcast, “Only Here,” about life and culture in San Diego and Tijuana — “the art, food, traditions and culture that exists because of the border,” they write. The first episode profiles a young photographer who is gay and undocumented,and you can listen to it, along with other episodes, here.
Podcast creators, like everyone else, have been drawn to stories and conversations about the border. If you prefer your stories in audio form, here are a few more to get you started:
• “The Green Line,” produced by the union of Border Patrol agents. The hosts, Art Del Cueto and Brandon Judd, are Border Patrol agents who have been supportive of President Trump’s policies — and bothappeared at his sidein the White House briefing room in January when he talked about declaring a national emergency to help build a border wall. (The Times has written about them before.)
• Last spring, WNYC’s Radiolab ran “Border Project,” a three-part series about a Border Patrol policy that most likely led to a rise, beginning in the late 1990s, in the number of migrants who died while crossing to the United States. It also profiles some of the migrants who made the trek despite it.Listen to all the episodes here.
• This episode of PRX’s Radio Diaries, “The Border Wall,” focuses on those strange parts of the border that one woman calls a “no-man’s land,” cut off from their country by a barrier that doesn’t always follow the line it’s meant to.
• Our very own “Daily” podcast has many great episodes from the border. Start with a two-part series, “Dispatches From the Border” (Part 1 hereandPart 2 here), which follows Azam Ahmed, the Times bureau chief for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, and other Times journalists on a trip along the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico. Then there’s this episode, “The Scars of Family Separation,” about a migrant father who crossed the border with his daughter. Finally, from last summer, “How Separating Migrant Families Became U.S. Policy” is an interview with Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser who has helped the president frame his immigration policy.

Golf Roundup
ByThe Associated Press
Ally McDonald made a 5-foot birdie putt on the final stroke of the first round on Thursday to take the lead in the ANA Inspiration.
McDonald shot a four-under-par 68 at Mission Hills in Rancho Mirage, Calif., playing in the last group of the day off the first tee. The tree-lined course was made more difficult with thick rough, tighter fairways and some lengthened holes.
She birdied all four par-5 holes, the last in fading light on the water-guarded 18th.
“I just drove the ball really well,” McDonald said. “Gave myself a lot of opportunities to make good approach shots into the green.”
Only 28 of the 112 players broke par in the tournament, the first L.P.G.A. major championship of the year, with McDonald and the other afternoon starters facing gusts. She had a one-stroke lead over the 2014 champion, Lexi Thompson; Jin Young Ko; Hyo Joo Kim; and Linnea Strom. Thompson, Ko and Kim played in calmer morning conditions, but with the thick rough wet from dew.
McDonald, 26, played at Mississippi State after becoming the only female player to win the state boys’ high school championship. She had made only two previous starts this season, her third on the tour. She tied for 58th two weeks ago in Phoenix in the Founders Cup and missed the cut last week in Carlsbad.
“I think in this position that I’ve never been in, it’s so easy to get ahead of yourself,” McDonald said. “For me, I’m just going to take it easy. I know that on the very first day, a great round is awesome, but there is so much more golf left to play.”
McDonald birdied the last three holes on the front nine and added another on the par-5 11th. She gave back a stroke on the par-3 14th before pulling ahead on 18.
Strom, also playing in the afternoon, made a 25-foot birdie putt on the par-3 17th, with the pin on the far right side, to reach four under. She then bogeyed the 18th after hitting her drive over the right-side cart path and under a tree. Strom was making her fifth start in her first season on the LPGA Tour.
“I know it’s a tough course, but there are some birdies out there,” said Strom, a former Arizona State player from Sweden.
Thompson birdied the final two holes, hitting to a foot on 18 after her caddie, Benji Thompson, talked her into a lower-lofted wedge.
“I wanted to hit my 50 degree, which was max what the yardage was,” Thompson said. “He was like, ‘No, just chip the 47, take the spin off, in case a gust does come up.’ Sure enough, it did. Just chipped up there. I was like, ‘Thank you so much, Benji.’ ”
Jessica Korda had seven birdies in an adventurous 70. She also had a double bogey after driving out of bounds on the par-4 third and three bogeys.
“A serious roller coaster,” Korda said. “Glad I got off it on 18.”
WOMEN’S PLAY AT AUGUSTAThe N.C.A.A. champion Jennifer Kupcho held on for a one-under-par 71 for a one-shot lead over Maria Fassi of Mexico in the Augusta National Women’s Amateur, leaving her one round away from a chance to become the first woman to win a tournament at the home of the Masters.
TEXAS OPENSi Woo Kim birdied five of his final eight holes for a six-under-par 66 and a one-shot first-round lead over four others in San Antonio. Ricky Fowler and Jordan Spieth were part of a group that was another shot back in the event, the last on the PGA Tour before the Masters.

Por Manny Fernández en Donna, Texas.
La primavera llegó a la frontera y eso significa que comienzan esos meses en los que decenas de miles de jubilados de Minnesota, Dakota del Sur, Illinois y otras partes del Medio Oeste de Estados Unidos adoptan al sur de Texas como su segundo hogar.
Los jubilados en traje de baño andan en bicicletas para llegar a las piscinas y suelen llevar flotadores de tubo bajo el brazo como lanzas de combate a caballo. Desfilan por la calle con sus carritos de golf. Se aventuran a ir a México para comprar medicamentos más baratos, hacerse pedicuras o tratamientos dentales de bajo costo y beber margaritas en copas enormes.
Se les conoce comoWinter Texans(texanos invernales) y se concentran principalmente en el valle del río Grande, la región templada al sur de Texas que también es la zona por donde pasan la mayor cantidad de migrantes desde Centroamérica (el presidente Donald Trump ha declarado una emergencia nacional en la frontera y ha apostado a soldados del Ejército para ayudar a controlar la creciente afluencia ). Uno de sus campamentos base estaba a menos de un kilómetro del centro vacacional Victoria Palms en Donna, adonde llegan muchas personas mayores para ocupar cinco canchas depickleball,un juego que es una mezcla de bádminton, tenis y ping pong.
La invasión anual de los residentes del Medio Oeste —y unos cuantos canadienses— ha disminuido en años recientes, pero siguen representando una importante fuerza económica y cultural. Unos 106.000 visitantes invernales gastaron alrededor de 528 millones de dólares en el valle durante la temporada de invierno de 2017-18, según una encuesta realizada por la Universidad de Texas Valle del Río Grande. Los restaurantes tex-mex montan pancartas para recibirlos. Hay periódicos para texanos invernales, parques para remolques con restricciones de edad mínima, exposiciones, cruceros, producciones teatrales y calcomanías de parachoques. Una camioneta en la ciudad fronteriza de McAllen tenía dos: “Texano invernal de Iowa” y “Estoy jubilado. Rebásame”.
“Me permite escapar de los bancos de nieve”, dijo Dean Miller, de 58 años, residente de Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, quien durante el invierno vive y trabaja en el centro vacacional Winter Ranch en Álamo, Texas. “Vas a un evento aquí y te encuentras a tu vecino de allá”.
La mayoría de los texanos invernales son de raza blanca y tienen 70 años o más. Muchos de ellos votaron por Trump en 2016, y su mera presencia contradice la afirmación que hizo el presidente acerca de que la frontera está en crisis. Vienen a la región desde hace años —en algunos casos, siguiendo la tradición de sus padres— y la dinámica política y la retórica de la emergencia nacional no afecta cómo viven su jubilación, ni dónde lo hacen.
“Nosotros no vemos lo que ustedes ven en la televisión”, dijo Terry Goss, director general de Victoria Palms, una de las comunidades más grandes de texanos invernales, con hasta 2500 jubilados.
¿Qué es exactamente lo que les atrae a los texanos invernales?
Conocer la vida fronteriza que no se parece en nada a lo que la mayoría de los estadounidenses imagina que es. Un viernes se celebró el cuarto evento benéfico de bailesock hopen el centro Ranchero Village en Weslaco. Hubo almuerzos de pescado y recorridos en bote por el río, baile de cuadrillas y sesiones de karaoke, conciertos improvisados debluegrassacústico y servicios religiosos ecuménicos.
Un lunes por la tarde, en el centro vacacional Winter Ranch en Álamo, la compañía teatral de Winter Ranch agotó las entradas en su presentación de tres obras de un solo acto:The Ethel and Albert Comedies. En Victoria Palms, Goss habló de pie junto a un cartel que mostraba todos los espectáculos agotados en el salón de baile del centro; uno de ellos era el concierto de una banda tributo a The Rolling Stones. Victoria Palms es tan popular con los canadienses que casi todos los veranos se programa una reunión de los huéspedes de Victoria Palms cerca de Toronto.
Margaret Hitzemann, de 63 años, habitante de Onamia, Minnesota, pasó los últimos dos meses en una casa en Port Aransas, cerca de Corpus Christi. Una tarde lluviosa, ella y su esposo cruzaron la frontera a pie hacia la ciudad turística de Nuevo Progreso, Tamaulipas. Compraron chapulines crujientes y fueron a una farmacia para comprar medicamentos baratos.
“No tomamos muchas medicinas, así que pensamos: ‘Ah, vayamos allá y compremos un poco de Tylenol y Advil, y cosas así, por menos dinero”, dijo Hitzemann. “Pensé: ‘Cielos, esto vale lo mismo en Walmart’. Así que al final no compramos ningún medicamento”.
En una región con una gran población latina y una actitud tolerante hacia la inmigración —muchas personas tienen familiares en ambos lados de la frontera— el choque cultural con los habitantes del norte es inevitable. El estudio publicado por la Universidad de Texas Valle del Río Grande incluyó mensajes sin editar enviados a funcionarios locales de parte de texanos invernales. Algunos de los comentarios más mordaces decían: “Sean más estadounidenses, menos mexicanos. ¡No estamos en México!” y “Hagan que el canal 5 respete a Trump” y “Poden el césped, recojan la basura y hablen inglés”.
Ya ha comenzado el éxodo de regreso al norte. El final de la temporada llegó para muchos el jueves 21 de marzo, con el Día del Turista, una fecha anual de aprecio a los texanos invernales en Nuevo Progreso.
Para algunos, la temporada nunca termina. Existen los texanos conversos, antiguos texanos invernales que se asentaron en el valle de por vida. Kristi Collier es originaria de McAllen y dirige una empresa hotelera y mediática que presta servicios a texanos invernales llamada Welcome Home, Rio Grande Valley. Ella organiza una fiesta anual de toma de juramento a los texanos conversos en abril.
Entre los conversos se encuentran Ken y Lois Lane, originarios de Anchorage, Alaska, quienes empezaron a pasar sus inviernos en Victoria Palms en 2005. Ahora viven ahí permanentemente en una casa móvil.
“Creo que el costo de vida aquí es muy razonable en comparación con muchos otros lugares”, opinó Ken, de 73 años, técnico electricista retirado que trabajaba para una compañía eléctrica.
Él y su esposa visitaron Nuevo Progreso y recibieron a su hijo y a su familia cuando vinieron a pasar las vacaciones de primavera desde Iowa. La pareja encaja en una categoría única: son una suerte de texanos invernales a la inversa.
“Conservamos la casa rodante y en el verano, cuando hace mucho calor, vamos al norte”, explicó Ken.

“Hay personas que simplemente dicen: ‘Mándenlos a todos de regreso y construyan un muro’. Pero, si eso ocurre, tendríamos anaqueles vacíos en las tiendas”.
—Mike McMahon, productor lechero en el norte del estado de Nueva York.
Las granjas en el norte de Nueva York están a miles de kilómetros de la frontera sur, pero están muy cerca de Canadá, por lo que la Patrulla Fronteriza tiene jurisdicción en esa zona. La dependencia que tienen los agricultores de los trabajadores indocumentados ha convertido a la región en un punto focal del debate sobre las políticas fronterizas del gobierno de Trump, lo cual ha exacerbado las tensiones entre los políticos estatales de ambos partidos y los agentes federales que ejecutan las medidas severas del mandatario en contra de la inmigración ilegal.
Esta semana, Christina Goldbaum, reportera sobre inmigración en la sección Metro de The New York Times, exploró en un artículo la historia de McMahon y la de los migrantes que trabajan en granjas como la de él. Lee más al respectoaquí.
Esta semana, la KPBS, una estación de radio pública del sur de California, lanzó un nuevo podcast,“Only Here”, acerca de la vida y la cultura en San Diego y Tijuana. Buscan mostrar “el arte, la comida, las tradiciones y la cultura que existen debido a la frontera”. El primer episodio presenta la historia de un joven fotógrafo gay e indocumentado, y puedes escucharlo junto con otros episodiosaquí.
Los creadores del podcast, al igual que todos nosotros, se han sentido atraídos por las historias y las conversaciones relacionadas con la frontera. Si prefieres conocer estas historias en formato de audio, aquí te presentamos algunos programas que te pueden interesar:
• “The Green Line”, producido por el sindicato de agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza. Los anfitriones, Art Del Cueto y Brandon Judd, son agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza que apoyan las políticas del presidente Trump, y ambos aparecieron a su lado en la sala de prensa de la Casa Blanca en enero cuando habló sobre una declaratoria de emergencia nacional para ayudar a la construcción de un muro fronterizo (el Times yaha escrito artículossobreellos).
• La primavera pasada, Radiolab de WNYC transmitió “Border Project”, una serie en tres entregas acerca de una política de la Patrulla Fronteriza que muy probablemente provocó un aumento, desde finales de los años noventa, en la cantidad de migrantes que morían al cruzar a Estados Unidos. También comparte las historias de algunos de los migrantes que emprendieron el trayecto a pesar de ello. Escucha todos los episodiosaquí.
• El episodio “The Border Wall”, de Radio Diaries de la PRX, se enfoca en las zonas recónditas de la frontera a las que una mujer se refiere como “tierra de nadie”, separadas de su país por una barrera que no siempre cumple con su propósito.
• Nuestro propio podcast “The Daily” tiene muchos episodios [en inglés] acerca de la frontera. Empieza con la serie en dos entregas, “Dispatches From the Border” (la primera parteaquíy la segundaaquí), que sigue a Azam Ahmed, jefe de corresponsales del Times para México, Centroamérica y el Caribe, y otros periodistasen un viaje a lo largo de los casi 3200 kilómetros de la frontera con México.
También está el episodio “The Scars of Family Separation”, acerca de un padre migrante que cruzó la frontera con su hija. Finalmente, el verano pasado se transmitió “How Separating Migrant Families Became U.S. Policy”, una entrevista con Stephen Miller, un asesor político de alto rango que ha ayudado al presidente Trump a estructurar su política de inmigración.
•SE BUSCAN: Traductores de lenguas indígenas centroamericanas. Los tribunales estadounidenses encargados de resolver asuntos migratorios tienen un retraso de 800.000 casos y el aumento en la llegada de migrantes procedentes de Centroaméricaha empujado la situación al límite, según las declaraciones de abogados, activistas e intérpretes en este reportaje.
Estados Unidos provee traductores en 350 lenguas de todo el mundo; sin embargo, no se da abasto en quiché, ixil o zapoteco, lenguas indígenas que están entre los veinticinco idiomas más recurrentes en las cortes migratorias. “Hay poblaciones enteras que se presentan con idiomas que no hemos visto antes en Estados Unidos”, dijo Odilia Romero, una intérprete de zapoteco y activista.
•El linchamiento de latinos y la recuperación de sus historias.A principios del siglo XX, los mexicanos y otros habitantes de ascendencia hispana fueron linchados y masacrados en el sureste estadounidense por “delitos” como rehusarse a tocar el violín o gritar “¡Viva [Porfirio] Díaz!”.

PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. — The AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am never fails to rattle Darius Rucker’s nerves. This year though, Rucker, the three-time Grammy Award winning musician, had more to fret about than hitting a spectator or getting in the way of his pro partner, Kenny Perry.
“Now you’re scared that somebody’s going to come call a rules violation on you with something that you don’t know about,” Rucker said before the tournament began last week.
The pros are just as worried. The United States Golf Association and the R&A revised the sport’s rule book to simplify the game and speed up the pace of play. But so far the changes, which took effect at the start of 2019, have been harder to follow than a game of Simon Says.
In the few weeks since the modifications took effect, players have repeatedly sought guidance from the nearest rules official, their caddies or pieces of paper tucked inside their golf bags, undermining for now, at least, the stated intention of making things simpler and faster.
And it’s adding an extra bit of hesitancy to the pros’ trip through the course. During a rain-sodden second round at Pebble Beach on Friday, Hunter Mahan was forced to consult a tournament-issued rules sheet before touching his ball. “We thought we knew what the rule was,” Mahan said, “but there’s no clarity, so having an official or actually having it written down is the only true clarification.”
One new rule has lowered the height from which players make a drop: it is now from the knees, rather than the shoulders, a change that the former men’s world No. 1 Adam Scott described as awkward. Whenever he bends over or squats with the ball, he can’t help but imagine rules officials assigned to monitor potential rules violations squinting at their screens, scrutinizing his release down to the inch.
“They’ve just written more gray areas into the game that were not necessary,” said Scott, who won’t make a drop without asking his caddie or a nearby official if he has the height right.
Even those enforcing the rules have been confused about how to interpret them. During the second round of the Phoenix Open earlier this month, Denny McCarthy was assessed a two-stroke penalty under Rule 10.2b(4), a new regulation that prohibits caddies from standing behind players as they line up for their shots.
While McCarthy took a few practice swings, his caddie stood behind him. McCarthy stepped away before hitting the shot, and when he came back to the ball and set his stance, his caddie was standing off to the side. The next day, the PGA Tour announced that it had rescinded the penalty after reviewing McCarthy’s actions, and his score of 67 became a 65.
Somewhat lost in the turbulence created by the alignment rule in the men’s game is the fact that the change was seen as directed at the L.P.G.A., where caddies lining up players had been more common. Brittany Lincicome, an eight-time L.P.G.A. tour winner and two-time major champion, said she was glad “it wasn’t one of us” who became the rule’s first victim.
After the caddie-alignment episode with McCarthy, and several similar situations involving other players, the U.S.G.A. and the R&A issued a clarification: If players reset their stances after their caddies have surveyed a shot, there is no penalty.
“Going in, we knew there were certain things that were going to come up that you’d say, ‘We’re not sure we contemplated this or the intention was never to have this outcome,’” Mike Davis, the chief executive of the U.S.G.A. told The Global Golf Post. He added, “All in all, in terms of how they’re being perceive around the globe, it’s very positive.”
That wasn’t the case for Rickie Fowler, who took dead aim at the caddie-alignment rule during the Phoenix Open. “You’re talking about growing the game and making things play faster and whatnot,” he said, “but that’s not growing the game.”
Adding to Fowler’s exasperation was a run-in with one of the rule book’s unchanged regulations on the Sunday of the tournament. He took a one-stroke penalty for hitting a shot into the water, then absorbed another one-stroke penalty after his ball rolled back into the hazard several seconds after he walked toward the green to survey his chip.
After carding a triple bogey, Fowler, in a show of gallows humor, petitioned the rules official, Slugger White, for a rules modification.
Fowler hung on to win, but Tony Finau, who watched the round unfold on television after missing the cut, saw the gravity in Fowler’s joking.
“As I watched that transpire, I couldn’t help but think, This is not what the integrity of the game is about,” Finau said. “He didn’t do anything for that ball to move.”
One player’s mishap is another’s teachable moment. An L.P.G.A. rules official disseminated the video of Fowler playing the hole, noting that he could have avoided the second penalty by making his first two drops, then using a tee to mark the spot where he intended to place the ball. After surveying his shot, he could have then replaced the tee with his ball before taking his shot.
Breaking up the sequence of drop-drop-place like that was illuminating to Lincicome: “I didn’t even know that was a thing,” she said.
Another new wrinkle on the course this year is using the flagstick as a backboard on putts; to speed up play, golfers can leave the pin in no matter where they are on the course, including the green. Anticipating the outcome, Bryson DeChambeau said last year, “The U.S.G.A.’s going to have to go back on that one, like, ‘No! We made the hole bigger!’”
It sure has seemed that way to Scott, who ranked 165th on tour in 2018 in strokes-gained putting. Putting with the flagstick in the hole, he is ranked No. 26. “To be honest,” Scott said, “it almost changes the whole aim of the game. It’s to hit the pin, not hole the putt.”
He added, “It takes speed out of your head so much. It even takes some reading of the green out.”
DeChambeau has a point. The game’s governing bodies might be eager to simplify the rules, but their intent was never to make the game easier.
And in the end, have they really simplified anything?
When Scott looks at the remaining layers of rules as well as the lingering and newfound confusion, he, like Fowler, wonders how it is growing the game. Imagine picking up an unfamiliar board game, he said, and opening the box to find 84 pages of rules. Would you bother playing it?
Now picture the same game, with only five or six rules to learn to start out. Which version would you find more appealing?
“Let’s have all the rules on the back of the scorecard for people to get into the game of golf,” Scott said, adding, “And then as you get playing more you can maybe learn some finer points of this very complex game.”
Though Jay Monahan, the P.G.A. commissioner, said last week that he felt proud of how quickly and nimbly the alignment rule confusion was addressed, Scott disagreed.
“We haven’t had a lot of changes in golf in the history of the game , and we’ve had a lot recently — rules changing weekly in some cases — and it’s crazy,” Scott said.
He added, “I think we’re becoming the laughingstock.”
An earlier version of this article misstated the number of strokes Rickie Fowler was penalized for hitting a ball into the water during the Phoenix Open. It was one stroke, not two.

Sarsfield, AUSTRALIA — Greg Carter really likes to golf. The Australian Vietnam War veteran enjoys it so much that one day in 2006, his wife Anne suggested that he put a hole in the yard of their sprawling 52-acre property.
“When I got over there, I looked across the valley and thought, gee whiz, I could put another one on that little hill,” he recalled, while giving a tour of the grounds recently. He mowed the grass and put in a few more holes, he said.
Thirteen years later, the result is a private golf course set in hilly farmland in the southeastern state of Victoria, about a three-and-a-half-hour drive from Melbourne.
But the meaning of the property to the Carters goes beyond the sport of golf. Since the course was built, the couple has opened up the grounds to Australian war veterans and their families to use as a cost-free retreat.
Mr. Carter was deployed in Vietnam for 12 months in 1969, and the idea for a retreat came to him after he realized the abrupt transition that many war veterans faced after returning home. For those reluctant to seek out government support or clubs, he said, there were few resources. While mapping out the course, Mr. Carter thought that the property, with its nature-steeped solitude, could offer veterans a place to feel safe, secure and away from the public.
Hundreds have used the retreat over the years, the Carters said, as a place to connect with others who understand what they’ve been through. For civilians who have not been to war, Mr. Carter said, the psychological impact of military service is difficult to understand.
After Mr. Carter opened the retreat, named Cockatoo Rise, and alerted veterans’ organizations, “the word got around reasonably quickly,” he said.
The property includes a 42-square-meter, or roughly 450-square-foot, home, six fenced paddocks, a large shed, a garden and an outdoor barbecue area.
But the Carters are approaching their 70s and looking to sell. They have put the entire property, which includes a four-bedroom, two-bath house, on the market. “For somebody who’s retired, this would be the dream,” Mr. Carter said. “They can make their rules up and their own dress code.”
The asking price is 1.79 million Australian dollars, or about $1.27 million.
In recent years, the housing market has boomed in nearby Bairnsdale, real estate agents said, with interest from investors from cities like Melbourne and Sydney. But only a few properties in the area sell for over 1 million Australian dollars, putting the Carters’ home on the very high end of the market, said Ross Tucker, a sales consultant at LJ Hooker Bairnsdale. In the last seven years, Mr. Tucker said, two nearby properties have sold for more than 1 million dollars: a colonial mansion on five acres on a river and an architecturally distinctive house set on two acres.
In Bairnsdale, the average price for a three-bedroom home is about 300,000 dollars, Mr. Tucker said. The price of farmland is more varied: land with rich soils used for agriculture can sell for about 12,000 dollars an acre and bushland for as little as 2,000 dollars an acre.
Property values also come down to location, said Sean Sabell, a director at Elders Real Estate Bairnsdale, with some buyers willing to pay more for water and mountain views.
Originally, Mr. Carter laid out an 18-hole course, but he eventually scaled it back to nine.
It took about six years for it to come together. Mr. Carter mowed fairways and planted gum, lilly pilly and protea trees. A line of pines traces one fairway, though such trees are rare on Australian golf courses because their root systems can grow into fairways and disturb the game, Mr. Carter said.
Water from a dam on the property is used to water the greens. In recent months, to conserve water during an especially dry Australian summer, nine tee boxes have been set up around four holes, allowing for abbreviated play.
The main house, built when the Carters arrived 15 years ago, has an open-plan design, with high ceilings and sliding-glass windows to let in the light.
The building’s main draw is an outdoor dining area facing south, with a 300-degree view overlooking the undulating landscape to the nearby waters of the Gippsland Lakes and to the mountains in the west. Often, visiting veterans will sit there alongside a rock-bordered pond and its goldfish.
Because the Carters regularly throw parties for friends, they make heavy use of their 60-foot-long (18-meter) living room, which includes a fireplace and an indoor pond.
The surrounding Gippsland Lakes region includes parks, bushland and some of the country’s largest waterways. Bairnsdale, a town ofabout 15,000 people, is minutes from the property and the local community is close-knit.
Currently, the shed houses a museum, where Mr. Carter displays a vast collection of wartime relics, including uniforms, replicas of mines and ration packs. The museum will move with them when they leave. “We haven’t set this up to relive the war,” Mr. Carter said. “It’s a teaching ground.”
Some of the veterans the Carters have hosted are homeless or struggle with mental health issues. One Afghanistan veteran called Mr. Carter, despondent, after 19 fellow servicemen had committed suicide. “He had hit rock bottom,” Mr. Carter said, wiping away tears.
On most evenings, the Carters keep a campfire burning on a corner of their property. Sometimes, the veterans who gather there are silent. But other times, lulled by the fire and the nature around them, they start talking about what they remember.
John Cottom, a Vietnam veteran who visited the retreat in February, said he has found that psychiatrists can be intimidating to talk to about wartime experiences. Apart from the Carters, the best part of the Cockatoo Rise retreat, he said, is meeting other veterans.
“You can sit down and talk and you don’t have to explain things” said Mr. Cottom, who is 71. “You relax and let some things out.”
Although he hasn’t met anyone he served with, he said, “It’s like we know each other. It’s a special friendship.”
The wives of veterans, he added, are made very welcome, too. “The women are often overlooked, but they’ve gone through hell, too, putting up with us,” Mr. Cottom said.
Frank Hoy, 70 and a veteran of the Royal Australian Navy, first visited the retreat from his home in Melbourne four years ago and has returned several times. “We sit around the fire and solve the problems of the world,” Mr. Hoy said.
Several real estate agents in the area expressed skepticism that the Carters could achieve their asking price, but the couple said that they have done their research and are not fazed.
At dusk, native birds and other wildlife emerge from hiding. After Mr. Carter’s tour, several cockatoos alighted on a eucalyptus tree by the kitchen window. A few eastern grey kangaroos appeared and nibbled the grass.
“We’ve got a really old boy that comes through every night,” Anne Carter said, adding that sightings of echidnas — also known as spiny anteaters — and wombats are also common.
“It’ll be a disappointment for Anne and I to leave here,” Mr. Carter said as a kangaroo peered into the house. The Carters plan to take the Cockatoo Rise name with them to their next home but hope the property’s next owners will consider keeping it accessible to veterans. “We’d be delighted if they did that. Absolutely delighted,” Mr. Carter said.

PARIS — Rejecting complaints that heavy police use of golf-ball-size rubber bullets has caused serious injuries, including blindness and fractures, during the Yellow Vest protests, France’s highest administrative court Friday upheld the legality of the weapons.
The ruling was a boost for the French government’s tough police strategy in the face of a popular uprising that is diminished but still vigorous.
Dozens have beenmutilated or blindedby the projectiles over weeks of Yellow Vest demonstrations, according to victim advocates. Bystanders, passers-by, people with their arms in the air, and journalists have been hit. Jaws have been fractured, hands crushed, eyes shot out.
Their use — overuse, critics say, with more than 9,200 firings recorded, including forbidden shots to the head — have come to symbolize an increasingly fierce police response to the Yellow Vests, especially after a protest leader’s eye was seriously injured last week.
But in its ruling upholding the use of the projectiles, the high court, called the Council of State, instead underlined the violence of the Yellow Vest protests, which at their peak in December shook the government of President Emmanuel Macron.
And the court noted fears that this violence would continue, as the Yellow Vests prepared for a 12th consecutive weekend of protests this Saturday, organized as a tribute to victims of what is deemed police violence. Protesters planned to brandish portraits of the injured leader, Jérôme Rodrigues, his eye shut tight; the police are investigating that shooting.
The court’s decision came in the same week Mr. Macron’s government bolstered its anti-Yellow Vest arsenal on the legislative front, pushing through much of a tough new “anti-vandals” law in the National Assembly, including a provision allowing officials to bar suspect individuals from taking part in protests, and a ban on face masks.
After weeks of violent protests punctuated by calls for his resignation, Mr. Macron has only recently been seen as regaining the upper hand, pushing a new strategy of dialogue with citizens in meetings all over France. His government has put an increasingly negative spin on the protests: “These are not demonstrations, they are urban riots,” said an Interior Ministry official, Pascale Léglise, at an emergency hearing before the high court on Wednesday.
The government has insisted that the 40-millimeter rubber-bullet guns and their projectiles, about the size of golf balls, are essential tools for the police. But their use makes France an outlier with respect to Western Europe, if not the United States. French police officers, and particularly the heavily armored paramilitary anti-riot CRS force, have historically been granted wide latitude in suppressing demonstrations.
American police officers made frequent use of rubber bullets during the protests in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014, sometimes causing serious injuries. In France the country’s official human rights watchdog has urged banning them for crowd control.
Still, the strategy of an uncompromising police response to the Yellow Vests — heavy use of tear gas, nonlethal rubber bullets and water cannons — appears to have helped reduce the severe urban vandalism of the protests’ early days, when the streets of Paris’s luxury districts were littered with burning cars and smashed store windows.
This strategy has been met with approval from a key right-leaning constituency being wooed by Mr. Macron, whose approval ratings have only recently begun to edge up after sagging to record lows.
His political difficulties are not over, however, and he acknowledged to French journalists this week that he was still “walking on ice” even as the Yellow Vests have begun to form candidate lists for the coming European elections.
Human rights activists have criticized the toll so far exacted by the so-called defense bullet-launchers: over 350 people, including dozens of journalists, have been wounded or mutilated, with 159 struck in the head and as many as 17 losing eyes. The police acknowledge there have been four blindings.
“This weapon is simply too dangerous to use in a demonstration,” Regis Froger, a lawyer for the leftist union CGT, said during the emergency hearing this week before the high court. “It’s a weapon designed to wound and mutilate,” he said. “And there is a real dissuasive effect on the right to demonstrate.”
To his left in the ornate court chamber sat four Yellow Vest victims of shootings who had traveled to Paris from the southern city of Montpellier, one still bearing a livid scar on his face. Another, Cynthia Lubin, a 31-year-old saleswoman shot in the forehead, wept.
But the French court on Friday endorsed the police argument that it could not keep the peace without rubber bullets, even as it noted that “very serious” injuries had resulted.
The “numerous demonstrations” all over France “have frequently been accompanied by gratuitous violence, assaults, vandalism and destruction,” the court said. “Because it is impossible to rule out such incidents in future demonstrations, it is necessary for law enforcement to continue to use these weapons, particularly appropriate in these situations,” the court wrote in its decision.
“We haven’t talked about the police victims,” Ms. Léglise of the Interior Ministry said during the emergency hearing. “It would be irresponsible to ban it.”
The human rights lawyers immediately vowed to appeal Friday’s decision. “It’s a disappointment,” said Patrice Spinosi of the LDH, the Human Rights League. “We haven’t succeeded in preventing it for this weekend. There will be consequences. And we’re going to appeal.”
Police specialists have weighed in against the rubber-bullet guns, comparing France’s stance unfavorably with that of other European countries — Austria, Britain, Denmark, Finland, Germany, and Norway, for the most part, among others — that ban the weapon.
“From the medical point of view there are good reasons not to use it,” said Sebastian Roché of the CNRS research institute. “And the countries that forbid them are the most thoroughgoing democracies.”
“It’s a question of democracy,” he said. “You can do better without these weapons. Look at Germany or Belgium.”
But Mr. Roché said the French judicial authorities would not go against the police unions.
Indeed, French television coverage Friday was dominated by police union representatives expressing satisfaction with the ruling.
Ms. Lubin, the Yellow Vest activist who attended Wednesday’s hearing, expressed fear and anger at the ruling. On Dec. 29 she passed out after a police officer fired a rubber bullet that struck her head during a demonstration at the Montpellier train station.
“I saw something dark, and I heard a noise,” she recalled. “I was 10 meters from him. I looked around, and I took the bullet, square in the forehead. I was stunned. I turned around and around. I was on the ground. Blood was coming out. I was on the ground. Then, the ‘street medics’ came to help me.”
She added: “Now, I am frightened every day. I sleep badly. This has shaken up our whole family.”

By Manny Fernandez in Donna, Tex.
It’s springtime on the border, and that means the winter season is winding down — the months when tens of thousands of retirees from Minnesota, South Dakota, Illinois and other parts of the Midwest adopt South Texas as their home away from home.
Retirees in swimsuits ride their bicycles to the pool, bright noodles tucked under their arms like jousting lances. They line the streets for golf-cart parades. They venture into Mexico, shopping for cheap medicine, getting pedicures, undergoing low-cost dental work and sipping goblet-sized margaritas.
They are known as Winter Texans, and they concentrate mainly in the Rio Grande Valley, the temperate region deep in South Texas that is also the place where the largest number of migrants has been crossing lately from Central America — President Trump has declared a national emergency along the border and stationed Army troops to help control the escalating influx. One of their base camps was a quarter-mile from where seniors at the Victoria Palms resort in Donna deploy by the dozens to occupy five pickleball courts.
The annual invasion of Midwesterners — and a number of Canadians — has decreased in recent years, but they remain an economic and cultural force. An estimated 106,000 Winter Texans spent about $528 million in the valley in the 2017-18 winter season, according to a survey by the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. Tex-Mex restaurants fly welcome banners for them. There are Winter Texan newspapers, age-qualified RV parks, expos, cruises, theater productions and bumper stickers — one pickup truck in the border city of McAllen had two: “Iowa Winter Texan” and “I’m retired. Go around.”
“It gets me out of the snowbanks,” said Dean Miller, 58, a resident of Detroit Lakes, Minn., who spends the winter living and working at the Winter Ranch resort in Alamo. “You’ll go to some event down here and you’ll find your neighbor from back home.”
The majority of Winter Texans are white and in their early 70s. Many of them voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, and their very presence this winter quietly subverted the president’s assertion that the border is in crisis. They have been coming to the region for years — in some cases, their parents were Winter Texans, too — and the political dynamics and national-emergency rhetoric has no effect on how, or where, they spend their retirement.
“We don’t see what you see on TV,” said Terry Goss, the general manager of Victoria Palms, one of the largest Winter Texan communities, with up to 2,500 retirees.
What do Winter Texans see, exactly?
A slice of border life that looks nothing like what many Americans think of as border life. There was Nathan’s fourth annual Sock Hop at Ranchero Village in Weslaco one Friday. There were fish frys and riverboat tours, line dancing and karaoke sessions, bluegrass acoustic jams and nondenominational church services. At the Winter Ranch resort in Alamo one Monday afternoon, the Winter Ranch Players packed the house with three one-act plays, “The Ethel and Albert Comedies.” At Victoria Palms, Mr. Goss spoke standing next to a poster listing all the sold-out shows at the resort’s ballroom, one of them a Rolling Stones tribute band concert. Victoria Palms is so popular with Canadians that a Victoria Palms reunion is scheduled most summers near Toronto.
Margaret Hitzemann, 63, who normally lives in Onamia, Minn., spent the past two months in a townhouse in Port Aransas, near Corpus Christi. One rainy afternoon, she and her husband visited the Mexican tourist town of Nuevo Progreso. They bought crispy chapulines — crickets, a fried delicacy — and went into a pharmacy to buy some cheap medicine.
“We don’t take a lot of meds, so we were thinking, ‘Oh, let’s go down and get some cheap Tylenol and Advil and that kind of thing,’” Ms. Hitzemann said. “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, this isn’t any cheaper than Walmart.’ So we ended up not buying any medications.”
In a region with a large Latino population and tolerant attitudes toward immigration — many people have family members on both sides of the border — culture clash with the Northerners is inevitable. The study released by the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley included unedited messages from Winter Texans to local officials, and some of the sharpest comments read: “Be more American, less Mexican. This is not Mexico!” and “Have channel 5 respect Mr. Trump” and “Keep the grass cut, the trash picked up and speak English.”
Already, the exodus back north has started. The end of the season for many comes on Thursday, with the annual Winter Texan appreciation day in Nuevo Progreso.
For some, the season never ends. There are Converted Texans, former Winter Texans who settle in the valley for good. Kristi Collier, a McAllen native who runs a media and hospitality company that caters to Winter Texans called Welcome Home, Rio Grande Valley, hosts an annual Converted Texan Fiesta in April. (She leads a swearing-in ceremony.)
Among the ranks of the converted are Ken and Lois Lane, originally from Anchorage, who started spending winters at Victoria Palms in 2005. They now live there permanently in a double-wide mobile home.
“I think the cost of living here is very reasonable, compared to many other places,” said Mr. Lane, 73, a retired power dispatcher for an electrical company.
He and his wife visited Nuevo Progreso and hosted their son and his family from Iowa over spring break. The couple is in a unique category: sort of reverse Winter Texans.
“The motor home we kept and in the summer when it gets real hot, we go up north,” Mr. Lane said.

“There are people out there who just say, ‘Send them all back and build a wall.’ But they would be facing empty shelves in the grocery store if that were to happen.”
— Mike McMahon, a dairy farmer in upstate New York.
The farms of upstate New York are thousands of miles from the southern border, but close enough to the northern one that the Border Patrol has jurisdiction. Farmers’ reliance on undocumented workers had made the region a focal point in the debate over the Trump administration’s border policies, leading to tensions between state politicians of both parties and the federal agents enforcing the president’s crackdown on illegal immigration.
Christina Goldbaum, an immigration reporter in The New York Times’s Metro department, explored Mr. McMahon’s story, and those of migrants who work at farms like his, in an article this week.Read more about it here.
This week, KPBS, a public radio station in Southern California, launched a new podcast, “Only Here,” about life and culture in San Diego and Tijuana — “the art, food, traditions and culture that exists because of the border,” they write. The first episode profiles a young photographer who is gay and undocumented,and you can listen to it, along with other episodes, here.
Podcast creators, like everyone else, have been drawn to stories and conversations about the border. If you prefer your stories in audio form, here are a few more to get you started:
• “The Green Line,” produced by the union of Border Patrol agents. The hosts, Art Del Cueto and Brandon Judd, are Border Patrol agents who have been supportive of President Trump’s policies — and bothappeared at his sidein the White House briefing room in January when he talked about declaring a national emergency to help build a border wall. (The Times has written about them before.)
• Last spring, WNYC’s Radiolab ran “Border Project,” a three-part series about a Border Patrol policy that most likely led to a rise, beginning in the late 1990s, in the number of migrants who died while crossing to the United States. It also profiles some of the migrants who made the trek despite it.Listen to all the episodes here.
• This episode of PRX’s Radio Diaries, “The Border Wall,” focuses on those strange parts of the border that one woman calls a “no-man’s land,” cut off from their country by a barrier that doesn’t always follow the line it’s meant to.
• Our very own “Daily” podcast has many great episodes from the border. Start with a two-part series, “Dispatches From the Border” (Part 1 hereandPart 2 here), which follows Azam Ahmed, the Times bureau chief for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, and other Times journalists on a trip along the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico. Then there’s this episode, “The Scars of Family Separation,” about a migrant father who crossed the border with his daughter. Finally, from last summer, “How Separating Migrant Families Became U.S. Policy” is an interview with Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser who has helped the president frame his immigration policy.

LOS ANGELES — Matt Kuchar said Saturday that the golden rule in his family is pretty simple and that it goes like this: “In any situation if you can just understand where somebody else is coming from, it makes the world a whole lot better of a place.”
Applying that rule, of course, isn’t always that easy, as Kuchar can certainly attest. His inability to put himself in the place of the local caddie he employed while winning a tournament in Mexico in November caused Kuchar a whole lot of heartache, and it was only on Friday that he decided to pay the caddie a lot more money for his work than he initially did.
“Listen, I was stubborn,’’ Kuchar said after he completed the rain-delayed second round of the Genesis Open at Riviera Country Club.
The problems for Kuchar began after hewon the Mayakoba Golf Classic in Playa del Carmento break a four-year winless streak and collected a $1.296 million first-place check. He then paid the caddie, David Ortiz, $5,000, an exceedingly small amount by professional golf standards. And once it became known what Kuchar had done, there was mounting criticism of him from inside and outside the sport.
At first, Kuchar, 40, doubled down in defense of the payment but after listening to fans publicly ridiculing him and receiving no great show of support from his fellow players, Kuchar thought some more and had a change of heart.
He issued a statement on Friday apologizing for what he acknowledged were insensitive comments he made about the payment and said Ortiz had now been paid a much bigger amount — apparently an additional $45,000.
“It’s been an interesting two or three days,” Kuchar said.
The controversy that Kuchar generated thrust into the spotlight one of the more private of public relationships in sports. Golfers and caddies are independent contractors thrust into a codependent relationship, bound by financial terms usually known only to them.
Regular caddieson major pro tours generally pay for their own travel, lodging and food, with no guarantees that the player they are working for will make any money in a given tournament or that they will earn anything more than the flat rate, usually $1,500 to $1,800 for a long weekend of work.
If the tournament is being held in a city with a high cost of living, that might not be enough for the caddie to break even. But because the regular caddies absorb a higher financial risk in signing on for bag duty than local caddies do when hired on the spot, they generally reap a higher reward, in the form of bonuses, when the golfer they are working for wins significant prize money.
But most of these arrangements are simply handshake deals. In the absence of a written contract, players have to let their consciences be their guides. Last season, Scott Langley became the first graduate of The First Tee — a program that promotes core values like integrity and respect — to win a PGA Tour-sanctioned event.
Using a local caddie, Langley won the Panama Championship in Panama City, Fla., on the Web.com tour, which is a notch below the PGA Tour. It was his first Tour-sanctioned victory as a pro, and he won $112,500. Langley proceeded to write a personal check to his caddie for more than $11,000 because he had agreed up front to pay him 10 percent of whatever he made at the tournament on top of the flat rate for a caddie, usually $500 to $800 on that circuit.
“I had an agreement with my caddie at the start of the week and I paid him accordingly,” Langley said on Saturday, with a shrug. “It’s on the player to be fair and generous.”
In the afterglow of his first victory in more than four years, Kuchar initially believed that he had done right by his caddie in bestowing upon him a $1,000 bonus in addition to the handshake agreement of $4,000 they had if he finished in the top 10. Ortiz later asked for $50,000, which he believed was a fair request for the input he had provided in reading greens and the local wind.
“In my mind, I had it as a deal is a deal,” Kuchar said, “but after I won the tournament, a deal wasn’t a deal. Not a good deal. Any transaction — all parties should come out feeling like they’ve won, and certainly in David’s case he did not feel like he won in that situation and I needed to make that right.”
That it took 96 days, the amount of time that lapsed between the victory last November and the wiring of money into Ortiz’s personal bank account, for Kuchar to pay Ortiz what the caddie believed he was owed can be ascribed, Kuchar said, to his own hardheadedness.
In any case, with two victories this season, Kuchar entered this week as the FedEx Cup points leader. He is entered in next week’s tournament in Mexico City, which offers slightly more FedEx Cup points because it is a World Golf Championships event.
After being heckled recently by American fans chanting, “Pay your caddie,” Kuchar said he was not concerned about the reception he will receive on Mexican soil.
“I think people know me,” he said, adding, “My experiences there have just been top-notch.”

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Keith Mitchell has attended the Masters four or five times, and he has played Augusta National five times through friends, his time playing at Georgia or a practice round when he qualified by winning the Honda Classic.
None of that prepared him for Monday.
"I was nervous just simply walking across the range," Mitchell said. "And then I started hitting some putts and some balls, and I started feeling better. But this place is just magical for anyone and everyone."
Mitchell is among 17 players making their Masters debut this week, which includes the six amateurs. Every one has watched it on TV and has dreamed of playing. Perhaps it was actually attending the tournament that made it different for Mitchell.
"I've seen that range from the other side of the ropes before, and I've always watched people and admired how they hit the shots and hit their wedges and the shapes of the drivers," he said. "And then I was the guy that people were watching. I think it's just kind of neat seeing it from the other side."
But that begs the question: Were they actually watching him?
"No," Mitchell said with a laugh before adding: "I felt they were. I wanted them to."
His goal this week is to feel like he belongs, which is more about shedding the awe. Mitchell already has taken his place in golf by beating Brooks Koepka and Rickie Fowler with a birdie on the last hole to win the Honda Classic.
"I still kind of feel like a rookie and still feel just kind of in awe of the place, and I hope that never goes away," he said. "But at the same time, I want to be more comfortable inside the ropes out here. That's tough, because only experience and time can change that. ... Everybody is saying, 'Enjoy your first trip, soak it in, have fun.' I'm trying. But I'm also playing in one of the biggest tournaments in the world, and you want to play well."
READY RICKIE
Rickie Fowler knows he can play well on the weekend with a major championship on the line. What is still missing is a celebration after the final shot.
Fowler returns to Augusta National brimming with confidence after shooting 65 and 67 over the last two rounds of the 2018 Masters.
Unfortunately, it wasn't quite enough to overtake Patrick Reed, who held on for a one-stroke victory and his first major title.
"Just have to do one better," Fowler said Monday.
At age 30, he is eager to break through with his first championship in one of golf's signature events. Though he has also had runner-up finishes in the U.S. Open and British Open, as well as a tie for third at the PGA Championship, Fowler believes Augusta might be his chance for major No. 1.
"I love this place just because of how much it allows you to use your imagination," he said. "I can putt well around here. I love putting these greens."
Fowler was asked if he had any regrets about last year's close call.
"I left it all there," he replied. "It would have been nice if there was one more hole, when it was all said and done, but no, I hit the shots that I wanted to."
MASTERS STATS
Mark Broadie, the Columbia professor behind the "strokes gained" statistics on the PGA Tour that rank players compared with the rest of the field, produced some analyses about the Masters that confirm it's a test unlike any other.
In an article for golf.com, Broadie writes that players make 2% more of their 6-foot putts at Augusta National — a high figure — compared with typical PGA Tour events, mainly because the greens are so manicured that they roll true.
"Players sink more putts inside 10 feet at Augusta than anywhere else," he wrote.
However, Broadie said over the last four years Augusta National has the highest three-putt rate of any PGA Tour event — 5.4%, compared with the average PGA Tour rate of 3 percent.
He also looked at proximity to the hole on shots from 125 to 200 yards. Augusta National ranked No. 1 in difficult, with players averaging 31 feet from the hole, compared with 26 feet as the PGA Tour average.
"Put another way," Broadie writes, "Masters competitors leave shots as close to the pin from 150 yards as players do on all other Tour venues from 170 yards."
AMATEUR HOUR
NBC Sports says it received a .96 overnight rating for its coverage from noon to 3 p.m. Saturday of the inaugural Augusta National Women's Amateur, where Jennifer Kupcho played her final six holes in 5-under par to win.
It was the highest-rated amateur golf telecast — men or women — in 16 years, dating to the 2003 U.S. Amateur championship match that got a 1.36 overnight rating.
The tournament began with a GOLF Films short titled, "When I Grow Up, I Want To ...," which the network says has nearly 1 million views on social media.

An undocumented immigrant who worked at one of President Trump’s golf clubs in New Jersey for years and recently spoke out about her experience will attend his State of the Union address after being invited by her Democratic congresswoman, the woman’s lawyer and the congresswoman’s office said Wednesday.
The undocumented immigrant, Victorina Morales, had worked as a housekeeper at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., since 2013, and spoke to The New York Times aspart of an article published last month. The report revealed that the president’s company — the Trump Organization — was, for years, employing people at the golf club who are in the country illegally.
In a brief interview on Wednesday, Ms. Morales said that on the advice of her lawyer, she stopped going to work on Dec. 4, two days before the Times article was published. Still, the lawyer, Anibal Romero, said that neither he nor his client had received notice that she had been fired. He said Ms. Morales’s employment status with the golf club was not entirely clear.
Since leaving her job, Ms. Morales, who is from Guatemala, has campaigned for rights and fair treatment for undocumented immigrants. On Wednesday, she said she was pleased to have been invited tothe State of the Union, that she has accepted the invitation and that she was “very proud because I am going to raise my voice for all of us immigrants.”
“I’m not scared to show my face,” she said, speaking in Spanish. “I am not speaking for me, I’m speaking on behalf of millions of undocumented immigrants who live in the United States.”
The congresswoman, Bonnie Watson Coleman, represents the New Jersey district in which Ms. Morales lives. The news that Ms. Morales had been invited to attend Tuesday’s State of the Union address as Ms. Watson Coleman’s guest was reported byThe Washington Poston Wednesday.
“Immigrants by and large are hardworking, trustworthy and skilled people who simply want to work and build better lives here,” Ms. Watson Coleman said in a statement. “For years these kinds of people were loyal and dedicated enough to be Trump Organization employees. I hope that in his State of the Union address, Donald Trump will finally acknowledge the real face of immigrants in this country — women and children fleeing violence; law-abiding, taxpaying people who would do almost anything to be Americans. And if he can’t, I’ve invited Victorina so that he may look her in her eyes to tell his lies to a familiar face.”
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday evening.
Mr. Trump has made border security and protecting jobs for Americans cornerstones of his presidency, and his insistence on building a border wall led to the recent partial government shutdown. He has labeled illegal immigration “a major, major problem,” and pledged to build a border wall while his administration has carried out workplace raids and payroll audits.
The Times article, published Dec. 6, said undocumented immigrants had been employed for years at the Trump National Golf Club as housekeepers, landscapers and kitchen staff. It also said they were kept on the payroll even though management was aware they had used phony documents to secure employment, as is common among undocumented immigrants.
Ms. Morales previously told The Times that a manager at Bedminster had helped her secure a new fake Social Security number and legal permanent-residency card after telling her that those on file had expired.
Since the article was published, about a dozen workers deemed ineligible to work in the United States because they lacked legal immigration status have been terminated at the Bedminster club, according to people familiar with the matter.
Another dozen were fired at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County, N.Y.,this month, a development first reportedby The Washington Post.
The Trump Organization also said late Tuesday that it wasputting in place a system to weed out undocumented immigrants who try to get jobsat its properties.
“I must say, for me personally, this whole thing is truly heartbreaking,” Eric Trump, an executive vice president with the Trump Organization, said in the statement on Tuesday. “Our employees are like family, but when presented with fake documents, an employer has little choice.”
He said that hiring undocumented immigrants was not a problem unique to the Trump Organization, and that it “demonstrates that our immigration system is severely broken and needs to be fixed immediately.”

AUGUSTA, Ga. — Only when Nick Faldo took a break after playing nine holes Sunday at Augusta National did he look differently.
At least to Matt Wallace.
Faldo was asked to present prizes for the Drive, Chip and Putt National Finals, and he had to look the part. The three-time Masters champion headed upstairs to his locker, slipped on his green jacket and returned to the trophy presentation.
Wallace, making his Masters debut, rushed over to Faldo and rubbed the sleeve of his jacket with his fingers.
"I love it," Faldo said. "I come here, open my locker, there's my jacket. I've got to tell you, it's pretty cool. It's a pretty special thing."
It's what everyone wants a week from Sunday, perhaps the most significant piece of clothing awarded in sports. And the race for it is as open as ever against the smallest field of the four majors.
Tiger Woods is going for his first Masters title in 14 years. Rory McIlroy is going for his first, which would be the last leg of the career Grand Slam. The last seven Masters champions were among the top 25 in the world, and six players from the top 10 in the world arrive at Augusta National having already won this year.
Players began filtering in at Augusta National in the last few days even as they had to share the golf course. The inaugural Augusta National Women's Amateur was held the previous two days, with 72 players practicing on Friday and the 30 players who made the cut competing on Saturday.
On Sunday, parts of the practice facility, the putting green and the 18th green were occupied by kids ages 7 through 15 for the sixth Drive, Chip and Putt.
"With yesterday and today, the buzz is unbelievable," Adam Scott said. "The kids are amazing, and it makes me feel like a kid again. As long as they're still finding it fun, these kinds of things are so good. Just wait — one day, a Drive, Chip and Putt champion will be a Masters champion."
Unique about the Masters, among many things, is that it's the only major organized and hosted by a private club.
Members can play the course through Sunday, and they often do. Only past champions, like Scott and Mike Weir, are allowed to bring guests. Scott has been bringing his father, Phil, since winning in 2013.
Faldo, who won his first green jacket 30 years ago and now is the lead analyst for CBS Sports, couldn't think of a better place to be.
"There's nothing like this," he said. "Sure, we're biased because we're in golf, but you tell me what sporting event is better than this, especially for a week? You'll get amazing matches at Wimbledon and all sorts of things. But this, for like 10 days, there's nothing, I don't think. You tell me what sporting event can top this."
One veteran European writer suggested the Tour de France.
Faldo pointed to umbrella-covered lawn tables and chairs outside the clubhouse, where visitors sipped on lemonade across from the putting green and first tee.
"You don't have this ambiance," he said. "Tour de France, you sit at a cafe and whoosh! There they go. And everyone says, 'Ooh-la-la!' And then what do you do?"
Nothing moves quickly at Augusta National except time.
Even as Sunday drew closer to the start of Masters week, so much of the chatter was on the Augusta National Women's Amateur, heralded as a wildly successful debut, especially with the way Wake Forest senior Jennifer Kupcho took on the par 5s and played the final six holes in 5 under to win.
Kupcho dreads going back to school next week. She was back on the course Sunday soaking up a win she considered bigger than her NCAA title last year, mainly because of the stage she was on and the effect on her sport.
"To get all the support that we've gotten from all the fans, all the press, it's unbelievable for the women's game," she said. "It was just unreal. I definitely had nerves, butterflies. And there's no words to describe it. It was just a great round, and it's probably the most fun I've ever had on a golf course."
By day's end, as no more than five players were on the range in late afternoon with no one around, the Masters started coming into view.
"Rory wins, it's the Grand Slam," Faldo said. "If Tiger wins, my goodness, what's that going to be? It might make the morning papers for three months."

Sarsfield, AUSTRALIA — Greg Carter really likes to golf. The Australian Vietnam War veteran enjoys it so much that one day in 2006, his wife Anne suggested that he put a hole in the yard of their sprawling 52-acre property.
“When I got over there, I looked across the valley and thought, gee whiz, I could put another one on that little hill,” he recalled, while giving a tour of the grounds recently. He mowed the grass and put in a few more holes, he said.
Thirteen years later, the result is a private golf course set in hilly farmland in the southeastern state of Victoria, about a three-and-a-half-hour drive from Melbourne.
But the meaning of the property to the Carters goes beyond the sport of golf. Since the course was built, the couple has opened up the grounds to Australian war veterans and their families to use as a cost-free retreat.
Mr. Carter was deployed in Vietnam for 12 months in 1969, and the idea for a retreat came to him after he realized the abrupt transition that many war veterans faced after returning home. For those reluctant to seek out government support or clubs, he said, there were few resources. While mapping out the course, Mr. Carter thought that the property, with its nature-steeped solitude, could offer veterans a place to feel safe, secure and away from the public.
Hundreds have used the retreat over the years, the Carters said, as a place to connect with others who understand what they’ve been through. For civilians who have not been to war, Mr. Carter said, the psychological impact of military service is difficult to understand.
After Mr. Carter opened the retreat, named Cockatoo Rise, and alerted veterans’ organizations, “the word got around reasonably quickly,” he said.
The property includes a 42-square-meter, or roughly 450-square-foot, home, six fenced paddocks, a large shed, a garden and an outdoor barbecue area.
But the Carters are approaching their 70s and looking to sell. They have put the entire property, which includes a four-bedroom, two-bath house, on the market. “For somebody who’s retired, this would be the dream,” Mr. Carter said. “They can make their rules up and their own dress code.”
The asking price is 1.79 million Australian dollars, or about $1.27 million.
In recent years, the housing market has boomed in nearby Bairnsdale, real estate agents said, with interest from investors from cities like Melbourne and Sydney. But only a few properties in the area sell for over 1 million Australian dollars, putting the Carters’ home on the very high end of the market, said Ross Tucker, a sales consultant at LJ Hooker Bairnsdale. In the last seven years, Mr. Tucker said, two nearby properties have sold for more than 1 million dollars: a colonial mansion on five acres on a river and an architecturally distinctive house set on two acres.
In Bairnsdale, the average price for a three-bedroom home is about 300,000 dollars, Mr. Tucker said. The price of farmland is more varied: land with rich soils used for agriculture can sell for about 12,000 dollars an acre and bushland for as little as 2,000 dollars an acre.
Property values also come down to location, said Sean Sabell, a director at Elders Real Estate Bairnsdale, with some buyers willing to pay more for water and mountain views.
Originally, Mr. Carter laid out an 18-hole course, but he eventually scaled it back to nine.
It took about six years for it to come together. Mr. Carter mowed fairways and planted gum, lilly pilly and protea trees. A line of pines traces one fairway, though such trees are rare on Australian golf courses because their root systems can grow into fairways and disturb the game, Mr. Carter said.
Water from a dam on the property is used to water the greens. In recent months, to conserve water during an especially dry Australian summer, nine tee boxes have been set up around four holes, allowing for abbreviated play.
The main house, built when the Carters arrived 15 years ago, has an open-plan design, with high ceilings and sliding-glass windows to let in the light.
The building’s main draw is an outdoor dining area facing south, with a 300-degree view overlooking the undulating landscape to the nearby waters of the Gippsland Lakes and to the mountains in the west. Often, visiting veterans will sit there alongside a rock-bordered pond and its goldfish.
Because the Carters regularly throw parties for friends, they make heavy use of their 60-foot-long (18-meter) living room, which includes a fireplace and an indoor pond.
The surrounding Gippsland Lakes region includes parks, bushland and some of the country’s largest waterways. Bairnsdale, a town ofabout 15,000 people, is minutes from the property and the local community is close-knit.
Currently, the shed houses a museum, where Mr. Carter displays a vast collection of wartime relics, including uniforms, replicas of mines and ration packs. The museum will move with them when they leave. “We haven’t set this up to relive the war,” Mr. Carter said. “It’s a teaching ground.”
Some of the veterans the Carters have hosted are homeless or struggle with mental health issues. One Afghanistan veteran called Mr. Carter, despondent, after 19 fellow servicemen had committed suicide. “He had hit rock bottom,” Mr. Carter said, wiping away tears.
On most evenings, the Carters keep a campfire burning on a corner of their property. Sometimes, the veterans who gather there are silent. But other times, lulled by the fire and the nature around them, they start talking about what they remember.
John Cottom, a Vietnam veteran who visited the retreat in February, said he has found that psychiatrists can be intimidating to talk to about wartime experiences. Apart from the Carters, the best part of the Cockatoo Rise retreat, he said, is meeting other veterans.
“You can sit down and talk and you don’t have to explain things” said Mr. Cottom, who is 71. “You relax and let some things out.”
Although he hasn’t met anyone he served with, he said, “It’s like we know each other. It’s a special friendship.”
The wives of veterans, he added, are made very welcome, too. “The women are often overlooked, but they’ve gone through hell, too, putting up with us,” Mr. Cottom said.
Frank Hoy, 70 and a veteran of the Royal Australian Navy, first visited the retreat from his home in Melbourne four years ago and has returned several times. “We sit around the fire and solve the problems of the world,” Mr. Hoy said.
Several real estate agents in the area expressed skepticism that the Carters could achieve their asking price, but the couple said that they have done their research and are not fazed.
At dusk, native birds and other wildlife emerge from hiding. After Mr. Carter’s tour, several cockatoos alighted on a eucalyptus tree by the kitchen window. A few eastern grey kangaroos appeared and nibbled the grass.
“We’ve got a really old boy that comes through every night,” Anne Carter said, adding that sightings of echidnas — also known as spiny anteaters — and wombats are also common.
“It’ll be a disappointment for Anne and I to leave here,” Mr. Carter said as a kangaroo peered into the house. The Carters plan to take the Cockatoo Rise name with them to their next home but hope the property’s next owners will consider keeping it accessible to veterans. “We’d be delighted if they did that. Absolutely delighted,” Mr. Carter said.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — NCAA champion Jennifer Kupcho became the first woman to win at Augusta National with a charge on the back nine so often seen at the home of the Masters.
Trailing by two with six holes to play, Kupcho boldly went for the green on the par-5 13th that set up eagle. That carried her to a sensational closing stretch and a three-shot victory over close friend Maria Fassi in the Augusta National Women's Amateur.
Kupcho, a senior at Wake Forest, closed with a 5-under 67, playing the final six holes in 5 under.
It capped off a big week at a tournament that Augusta National, which didn't have a female member until 2012, announced last year to help provide a spark for women's golf.
