The most recent,less thanSuper Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.
That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own. The latest effort is the Alliance of American Football, which plays its first games on Saturday.
There have been plenty of pretenders to the N.F.L.’s crown over the years. None have succeeded, but all had their share of novelty.

SeasonJuly to December
Weird rulesA touchdown was worth seven points; teams could then go for a conversion from scrimmage for one more “action point.” No sudden-death overtime; a full 15-minute quarter was played. No preseason.

TVABC and ESPN
The Times said: “Yesterday’s opening of the U.S.F.L. season occurred only five weeks after Super Bowl XVII, meaning pro football now exists for 11 months. It’s as if another baseball league was formed with a season that opened in December.”
LegacyIntroduced instant replay for officials’ rulings; won antitrust lawsuit against the N.F.L. but was awarded only $3 in damages.

SeasonFebruary to April

TVCBS, CBS Sports Network, TNT and NFL Network
The Times said:“The Alliance of American Football, though, will have to overcome the obstacles that others could not, including runaway expenses, limited media exposure and a lack of fans.”
Maybe a fierce rivalry will develop betweenSan Diego and Phoenix. Maybe a player will break out the way“He Hate Me”did in the XFL. Maybe Coach Spurrier will recapture his magic. The Alliance will have to roll a Yahtzee to succeed in the shadow of the N.F.L. But even if it fails, you can bet someone will soon line up to try again.
